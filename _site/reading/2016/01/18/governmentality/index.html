    <h1 id="rose-n-1991-governing-by-numbers-figuring-out-democracy-accounting-organizations-and-society-16-7-pp-673-692">Rose, N. (1991) Governing by numbers: Figuring out democracy. Accounting, organizations and society, 16 (7), pp.673–692.</h1>

<p>The essay looks at the relationship between quantification and democratic government or the relationship between democratic power and calculated power. Rose started his argument by first categorising the use of numbers into 4 classifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numerical calculations of majorities and minorities</li>
<li>Numerical calculations linking governments with the lives of the governed such as opinion polls</li>
<li>Numerical calculations based on authoritative powers over national life, such as balance in payments, gross national product&hellip;</li>
<li>Numerical calculations for governing: tax returns, counts of population.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this was an explanations of &ldquo;numericization of politics&rdquo;, then Rose goes on explaining the &ldquo;politics of numbers&rdquo; (p,674)</p>

<ul>
<li>Politics of accuracy</li>
<li>Politics of adequacy</li>
<li>Politics of use and abuse, &ldquo;elaborated in particular by civil liberties&rdquo;</li>
<li>Politics of privacy, deployed by libertarians.</li>
<li>Politics of ethics, morality of making decisions based on numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rose argues according to Starr and Alonso&rsquo;s work that there is a reciprocal and mutual constitutive relationship between numbers and Politics, In a way they are like map and terrain relationship, they both related to each others reality and creates each others essence and appearance.</p>

<h3 id="rose-39-s-hypothesis">Rose&rsquo;s hypothesis:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There is a constitutive interrelationship between quantification and democratic government. Democratic power is calculated power, and numbers are intrinsic to the forms of justification that give legitimacy to political power in democracies. democratic power is calculating power, and numbers are integral to the technologies that seek to give effect to democracy as a particular set of mechanisms of rule. Democratic power requires citizens who calculate about power, and numeracy and a numericized space of public discourse are essential fore making up self-controlling democratic citizens.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the question would be techniques to identify and study such phenomenons</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and knowledge&rdquo;, this is all Foucault&rsquo;s work</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To governs a domain &ndash; a population, an economy &ndash; has entailed seeking to exercise a power over it that is modulated by a knowledge of its laws, processes and conditions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and information&rdquo;, see more in Pasquale Pasquino&rsquo;s work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There can be no well-ordered political machinery or enlightened administration, they argue, without a knowledge of the state of the population, and the numbering of persons, goods, activities, births, crimes, deaths and much else provides the material on which administrative calculation can operate. (p, 676)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Centres of calculation, for more on this see Latour&rsquo;s works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To exercise power over events and processes distant from oneself it is necessary to turn them into traces that can be mobalised and accumulated. Events must be inscribed in standardized forms, the inscriptions transported from far and wide and accumulated in a central locale, where they can be aggregated, compared, compiled and calculated about.
&hellip;.
Further Rose suggests based on Ian Hacking&rsquo;s argument(1981)
&ldquo;Turning the objects of government into numericized inscriptions, then, enables a machinery of government to operate from centres that calculate.  &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Techniques of inscription and accumulation of facts about &ldquo;the population&rdquo;, the &ldquo;national economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. This renders a visible domain with a certain internal homogeneity and external boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The collections and aggregation of numbers participates in the fabruication of &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; within which thought and action can occur. Numbers here delineate &ldquo;fictive spaces&rdquo; for the operation of government, and establish a &ldquo;plane of reality&rdquo;, marked out by a grid of norms, on which government can operate. (Miller &amp; O&#39;Leary, 1987, Rose, 1988, Miller &amp; Rose, 1990).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Censor</strong> comes from Romans and it meant the person who censed they were in charge of counting people who are good at taxation, military and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> comes from 17th century German notion of a science of states.</p>

<p>Porter 1986, discussed the relationship between statistics and standardisation
Anthony Hopwood</p>

<blockquote>
<p>numbers, and the specialist knowledges and professional techniques associated with them &ldquo;can become implicated in the creation of a domain where technical expertise can come to dominate political debate&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following from Hopwood argument then Rose goes on to look at the analysis of the numericization, Cline Cohen implies that numericization happens because of the &ldquo;ordering capacity&rdquo; of the numbers through
1. &ldquo;Bond of uniformity&rdquo;
2. unlike orders to come together, like weather of London and New York.
3. Numbers can be stabalising, for example velocity can be decomposed to time and distance, population growth to fertility and mortality.
4. Numbers can be used for developing probability and measuring risks.</p>

<h1 id="rose-n-o-malley-p-amp-valverde-m-2006-governmentality-annual-review-of-law-and-social-science-2-pp-83-104">Rose, N., O’Malley, P. &amp; Valverde, M. (2006) Governmentality. Annual review of law and social science, 2, pp.83–104.</h1>

<p>Foucault, defined government in his lectures (Foucault, 2009) as &ldquo;an activity that undertakes to conduct individuals throughout their lives by placing them under the authority of a guide responsible for what they do and for what happens to them.&rdquo;
And as Rose&rsquo;s stated, Foucault in his lecture &ldquo;On the government of the Living&rdquo; defined Governmentality as &ldquo;understood i the broad sense of techniques and procedures for directing human behavior.&rdquo;
In &ldquo;Discipline and punish&rdquo; Foucault brought the idea of reason of state which replaces the older notion of government or art of governing based on traditional virtues such as &ldquo;wisdom, justice, liberality, respect for divine laws of human customs&rdquo; or common abilities &ldquo;prudence, thoughtful decisions, taking care to surround oneself with the best advisor&rdquo;.
Rose et.al suggest then that in the new art of governing, &ldquo;populations had to be understood by means of specific knowledges and to be governed through techniques that are attuned to these emergent understandings&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Liberalism</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Political rationality, a way of doing things that was oriented to specific objectives and that reflected on itself in characteristic ways.&rdquo; from Rose&rsquo;s article on Governmetality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rose&rsquo;s suggests from Foucault&rsquo;s Discipline and Punish that liberalisms is a technology of government in response to the critique of governing regimes being excessive. p3</p>

<p>Very important questions that Rose identified as ways to think and analyse power and governing regimes is to think about these(Think about Foucault&rsquo;s suggesiton about how he analysed formation of liberalism and read this questions):</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify styles of thought</li>
<li>Their conditions of formation</li>
<li>The principles and knowledges that they borrow from and generate</li>
<li>The practices that they consist of</li>
<li>How they are carried out- Their contestations and alliances with other arts of governing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I should think about banks here and their programs, for example About their styles of thought, the idea of credit as liberalism, the knowledge they borrow and produce, Their conditions of formation (Economy and market&hellip;)</p>

<p>Rose&rsquo;s suggests the following set of questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Who or what is to be governed?</li>
<li>To what ends should they be governed?<br>
Governmetality doesn&rsquo;t suggest that there is one body of government out there applying these rules or condition rather many of them working in conjuction for their own objectives and this will result in the following quesitons</li>
<li>Who governs what?</li>
<li>According to what logics?</li>
<li>Wit what techniques?</li>
<li>Toward what ends?</li>
</ul>
