I'm a PhD student based at school of design University of Edinburgh. My research is between school of design informatics and social anthropology.
The focus of my PhD is on **complicity**.

Comlicity means:
> Involved with others in an activity that is unlawful or morally wrong: the careers of those complicit in the cover-up were blighted.

I want to develop ways to engage with individuals and communities in more longitudinal ways around the topic of climate change and environmental issues.

#Supervisors:
