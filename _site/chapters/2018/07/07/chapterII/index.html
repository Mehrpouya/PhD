<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This chapter looks at the last 400 years of enumeration, high modernism and financialisation to provide a map of inter-related actors that created the world the way it is today. This will be through three lenses, from the perspective of knowledge production (Epistemology), Relationship between knowledge forms, corporations and legislation (technology) and finally last few decades of finantialisation. This chapter aims to thread through an amalgamation of philosophies, legislations, social movements and scientific breakthroughs which started during 16^th^ century and continued to this moment. These changes and approaches to individuals, society and community have changed our relationships not just with one another, but with the world to an extensive level. The purpose for the next two chapters are to identify some concerns and challenges caused by science and technology?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This chapter is developed in five sections. The aim of the first three sections is to offer an insight into some of the theoretical foundations and debates relating to technology. I will bring together references from fields of Philosophy, Science and Technology Studies (STS), Epistemology (study of knowledge) and Software engineering. My aim here is to first develop a clear line of inquiry and representation of a specific problem that arises from the way we relate and use technology as well as how we shape and make it. Philosophical enquiries will offer an insight into our understanding of technology and the hows: How to live with technology? ; How to communicate with/through it? ; How to protect our sense of being and identity and how to relate to it. The works that I referenced here from STS will offer a fresh insight into some of the current debates, concerns, and challenges that scholars from STS has raised over the past two decades. The epistemological explorations aims to justify and clarify specific problems posed and threatening the notion of our being, democracy and liberty in their widest sense and finally the Software engineering perspective helps to understand how we make and do things the way we do through the medium of technology. I made every attempt to bring together an in-depth and a wide range of substantial primary and secondary examples and discussions from academic literature, however due to the complexity and depth of each of the topics discussed and the fields that I fearfully entered, I would like to admit that it was not possible to give some of the scholars and fields enough attention that they deserved. I had to make this sacrifice in order to be able to develop an interdisciplinary response into a common concern and problem that all these fields explored and have in common. It is possible to dedicate a whole chapter or conduct a whole investigation into some of the works that I referenced here. For example: It is common practice to discuss and explore technology from a Heideggerian perspective, however there are about 17000 pages of primary work by him concerning the topic of &ldquo;being&rdquo; and it is outside the remit and focus of this thesis to take on the role of reviewing and interpreting all these works and its secondary sources (Harman, 2011).</p>

<p>The first section explores the literature from an STS and philosophical perspective, developing a historical overview of important themes such as technological determinism, a brief chronological overview of philosophers of technology with more focus on Heideggerian perspective of technology specifically its recent metamorphosis &ldquo;object oriented philosophy&rdquo;. In section two, I will investigate the dichotomy between localized forms of situated knowledge and universal ones. This will be through briefly exploring the notion of enumeration, some of its examples and in particular relevant studies tracing these practices in the last 400 years (context). Section three (specific issue) looks at the epistemological aspects of these practices, how do we get around to produce such knowledge forms? Finally in the last section I discussed how I produced the first substantial practice piece of this investigation in relation to the theories and literature explored in this chapter. At the end, I have reflected on some suggestions and arguments towards certain changes and approaches that could develop new forms of design thinking, discussing some elements of adversarial design, Disruptive design and Technological fluency. Leading ultimately to practices and productions of a more commensurable knowledge networks.</p>

<h2 id="i-a-brief-history-of-the-present">I. A brief history of the present</h2>

<p>Technology is entwined in every aspect of our lives. &ldquo;<em>Technologies feed, clothe, and provide shelter for us; they transport, entertain, and heal us; they provide the bases of wealth and of leisure; they also pollute and kill.</em>&rdquo; (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1999, p. 1). Whilst science and technology are being examined from variety of perspectives, In many of these argumentations there is a trace of technological determinism and using &ldquo;<em>power language</em>&rdquo;(Langdon Winner, 1980, p. 121) is common amongst both critiques and appraisers of technology. From a political viewpoint, it is crucial to objectify the technological determinism as it produces a passive attitude and discourages creative engagement with technology. From an intellectual standpoint technological determinism whilst producing knowledge and develops some aspects of our understanding of technology, it also reduces the relationship between society and things into a mere cause and effect relationship. Therefor it is vital to a) develop a historical and political understanding of the lines of enquiries about technology and what technology is. This endeavour is focused majorly on the fields of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and philosophy of technology. B) To develop a creative approach for crafting new technologies that can deal with fast pace of change and the new and old needs of our societies and communities. A framework that fosters and engages not only in crafting and making new technologies, but rather it is involved in shaping it and influencing it towards improvement of our beings, communities and environments.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas and the beliefs in technological determinism is well captured in a 5 parts 1993 TV series documentary showing the history of computers from Babbage to Silicon valley. The tone and narrative of this series has a model of &ldquo;before and after an invention&rdquo; approach. In this title, the history of computers is being told in a way that once an invention was introduced to society, it will then have the life of its own. This belief that technology is the primary force that brings change to society goes back to early days of industrial revolution. Amongst individuals who believe in technological determinism, there are two common approaches that they follow a) soft view b) hard view. Soft view is based on the belief that social change is caused by technological change; They also admit that technology can be affected and changed by social pressures. Hard view believers on the other hand does not take into consideration the effect of social pressures and they believe technology has its own autonomous momentum and force for change. (Smith and Marx, 1994)</p>

<p>Ulrich Beck in his very influential work in critique of science and technology states: &ldquo;&hellip;With good reasons one can proceed from the perspective that the history of sciences was always less a history of the acquisition of knowledge than one of mistakes and practical lapses. That is why scien­tific &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;explanations&rsquo;, and practical &lsquo;suggested solutions&rsquo; contradict each other diametrically over time&rdquo; (Beck, 1992, p. 159). What Beck (1992) argues is the fact that from 18th century until mid-twentieth century science functioned as a monopolised rational force of &lsquo;progress&rsquo; without enough necessary reflections and critiques of its own practice. He argues that there are two strands in the modernization process from &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; societies to industrialised ones. The strands are 1) primary and 2) reflexive. In the primary phase science is &ldquo;applied to a &lsquo;given&rsquo; world of nature, people and society. &rdquo; (Beck, 1992, p. 155). In this phase the scientization process lacks reflection of its own procedures, however in the second phase the enlightenment and truth that science promised will be demystified. The second phase can be traced back as early as the beginning of twentieth century. The first phase whilst promising to bring enlightenment, liberty and free us from traditions and naturally destined ways of life to an industrial one at the same time they end up in dissolving some of its own values. In the second phase however not only science is not the sole provider of solutions, but rather the cause of problems. Don Ihde in his foreword to new waves in philosophy of technology (Olsen, 2008), traced three main waves of philosophers of technology. The first wave included scholars such as Marx and Kapp. Kapp (1877) was one of the first authors who used the title philosophy of technology in the 19^th^ century. The first wave of thinkers were mainly concerned with industrial revolution and its consequences. The consensus among scholars during this wave was barely dystopian. Only after the Great War, strong voices of criticism and fear of autonomous technologies began to rise and emerge. Obviously there were also positive voices such as Franklin and Jefferson &ldquo;&hellip;For them progress meant pursuit of technology and science in the interest of human betterment&hellip;&rdquo; (Smith and Marx, 1994, p. 3) at the same time both were concerned with the implications of large scale technological reformations. Jefferson emphasized on the delicacy of liberty, virtue and power in society and on how they can easily become corrupted. Ihde argues that it was first the arts community who raised their concerns and fears of technology. One of the first works dealing with this new phenomena was Shelley&rsquo;s Frankenstein. Victor Frankenstein a researcher who has a strong belief in science, unable to recognise the consequences and ethics of his work and its creation the monster. Shelly&rsquo;s monster is very similar to how Beck (1992) describes the role and challenges of science in industrial societies in early twentieth century.</p>

<p>[]{#_Toc518296753 .anchor}Figure 1 Analysis of technological determinism (Misa, 1988)</p>

<p>Misa (1988, p. 310) identifies four major groups of philosophers of technology whom technological determinism can be traced in their work. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;as a justification for their field, as a theory to be elaborated (by Ellulians), as a theory to be rejected (by Marxists), and as the starting premise for a technological politics&hellip;&rdquo;.</em> The deterministic approach has taken a similar pattern of development amongst historians of business, cities and science specially between 1977 to mid-eighties. This decade is portrayed by Misa (1988) as the time where most historians saw technology the causal force for change in our societies or at least in Western societies.</p>

<p>Whilst many scholars since mid eighties have been emphasising on the importance of objectifying determinism, it is also important to remember that technology should not be considered as both the sole problem maker and solution provider. Heidegger (1977, p. 3) &ldquo;<em>&hellip;We shall be questioning concerning technology, and in so doing we should like to prepare a free relationship to it.</em>&rdquo; What Heidegger attempts to do in this essay is to represent the essence of technology and by essence, he means the way something endures its life through time and history. By essence, he refers to the original and true meaning of it and not the one distorted and corroded through roman translation and later taken by Christianity. The origin of the word essence comes from physis where Heidegger defines it as (1961, p. 14) &ldquo;<em>Physis is being itself, by virtue of which essents become and remain observable&hellip; Physis means the power that emerges and the enduring realm under its sway. This power of emerging and enduring includes \&quot;becoming\&rdquo; as well as \&ldquo;being\&rdquo;</em>&ldquo;.</p>

<p>One of Heidegger projects was to redefine the concept of &quot;being&rdquo; as he believed this would help us to understand and justify our relationship with many other constructs and things such as technology. In being and time (Heidegger, 1996) he applies a phenomenological method where he attempts to define being through a temporal study of human experience. The ontological approach that he took in being and time however was not complete and he did not manage to complete the task of redefining being. In introduction to metaphysics, he tried to continue with his enterprise however, he ended up presenting a detailed critique of western philosophy and hitherto did not manage to provide a complete understanding of being. Heidegger compares the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; in language to being. He provides several examples in spoken language where in each sentence &ldquo;is&rdquo; has a different meaning for example The car is mine (belongs to), The book is in the library (located), the ring is of gold (made of), etc&hellip; In all these examples and many more, &ldquo;is&rdquo; contains a prolific multiplicity of meanings. Similarly for &ldquo;being&rdquo; the definite range of meaning contained by &ldquo;the sphere of actuality and presence, of permanence and duration, of abiding and occurrence.&rdquo; (Heidegger, 1961, p. 92). Similarly, if we were to understand and define the essence of technology, this does not mean any specific technological thing. Since technology existed as long as civilizations, what Heidegger tries to clarify is questioning the basis and definitions of what we perceive as technology and our relationship with it. He believed (Heidegger, 1977, p. 26) &ldquo;when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.&rdquo;. As shown in the example above with the multiplicity of meaning, similarly the widely agreed and used definition of technology as a human activity or a means to an end is also merely an instrumental definition and does not overlay the real truth about the essence of technology. What Heidegger is trying to free us from is thinking everything through the medium of technology, instead of having a free relationship with it. In his early works until 1955 his work is arguably has a romantic anti-technology and anti-consumerism approach, potentially due to war effect similar to other science and technology critics after the Great War and Second World War. In his later work on the contrary he states that the concern and worries on the loss and destruction caused by technology is merely a technological thinking (Dreyfus and Wrathall, 2002). Heidegger emphases on the dangers of technological thinking &ldquo;In this dawning atomic age a far greater danger threatens-precisely when the danger of a third world war has been removed. A strange assertion! Strange indeed, but only as long as we do not meditate. In what sense is the statement just made valid? This assertion is valid in the sense that the approaching tide of technological revolution in the atomic age could so captivate, bewitch, dazzle, and beguile man that calculative thinking may someday come to be accepted and practiced as the only way of thinking.&rdquo; (1966, p. 56) . The technological thinking is when we lose our ability to mediate and the idea of subjectivity and objectivity becomes more fluid. Tiqqun (2001, p. 3) reminds us of this danger by stating that majority of critical thinkers of our time are negligent of the rise of &ldquo;<em>cybernetics as a new technology of government</em>&rdquo;. He later states that the cybernetics is based on the projection that all things (humans and non-humans) and their relationships are inherently algorithmically conditioned and reconditionable. This is what Foucault referred to as &ldquo;piloting&rdquo; (2005, p. 249) a model consisting of three techniques medicine, political government and government of the self. Foucault refers to the post twentieth century piloting as &ldquo;governmentality&rdquo; (Foucault et al., 1991, p. 102). The change that occurs during this century and beyond is the fact that the piloting is not merely concerned with self and others but it is concerned with everything. In July 2014 UK government introduced a new legislation Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIP) which was later called snooper\&lsquo;s charter. This act obliged Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to regularly capture and store internet and communication activities of their users. Whist the act was challenged and it is under review due to high level of public outcry and legal challenges (Cobain, 2018; &ldquo;Data Retention Directive - ORG Wiki,&rdquo; n.d.) it is one example amongst many others (for examples see: ) of what Deutsch (1963) called the &ldquo;Nerves of Government&rdquo;. Deutsch enterprise was to develop a new political theory that is concerned with the new era of governmentality. A politics that offers people the ability to &ldquo;that men should be more able to act in politics with their eyes open&rdquo; (Deutsch, 1963, p. 255). Barabasi (2003) explores many new field of science being developed in the 21^st^ century and find many similarities between them and exploring and introducing new sciences from a cartographic perspectives. Wiener (1961, p. 39) compares the 18^th^ to early 19^th^ centuries as being the age of steam engines, he then describes the 20^th^ century as age of communication and control. Wienar invented an approach of applying probability and statistical models into a network in order to represent and reproduce information that is uncertain based on what we know about a system. This line of enquiry was first developed by Wiener in order to predict the movement of aircraft during Second World War. The technology is now more mature and accessible in many occasions free of charge available online under navigational softwares[^1]. Similar to Barabasi who compares the network of internet with network of life on our planet and almost suggest they are indentical, Tiqqun (Tiqqun, 2001, p. 18) discusses the enterprise of neural network as they try to mimic human brain (Hecht-Nielsen, 1988; Schmidhuber, 2015). Inviting the reader to explore the present-day history of economic discourse as an &ldquo;information problem&rdquo; (Foucault (Rose, 1991, p. 105) calls this &ldquo;Power/knowledge&rdquo;). A trend in the last thirty years has started which is refered to as financlialization. Financialization is the transformation process that results in markets taking over every aspects of our life. For example: Russi (2013) shows the effect of market and informationization of food industry; Martin (2002) provides a detailed overview of techniques and practices of financialization both through regulations prioritised by governments as well as its presence in the education system; Sotiropoulos (Sotiropoulos et al., 2013) presents a fresh overview of capitalist power relations based on financial derivatives. Davis (2009) representing some of the underlying practices that has changed the American society and reshaped it into a market centred logic where individuals are becoming shareholder agents, resulting in many vital human needs becoming highly dependent on Stock and mortgage markets. Financialization increasingly gaining more attention within academia, for example in the UK Digital Economy is a research theme bringing together fields such as &ldquo;These include Energy, Transport, Manufacturing, Health and Care, Creative and Cultural and Service Industries (particularly those driven by data such as Retail, Insurance, Financial and Advertising).&rdquo; (&ldquo;Digital Economy Theme strategy - EPSRC website,&rdquo; n.d.) ). Kant (Matthews et al., 2000) describes the experience of this new form of capitalism as sublime experience, according to his there are two forms of experience: mathematically sublime, which is an experience where we deal with a confli between our rational and imagination. Our reason tells us things are restricted and limited and on the other hand our imagination provides an infinite representation of reality, in this mathematical sublime experience due to universalistic approach to knowledge representation, we encounter experiences that are so much larger than ourselves that we struggle to take them in as a whole. The other sublime experience that Kant discusses is dynamically sublime where an object seems so much bigger than stronger than ourselves that we will experience a strong sense of helplessness and weakness towards them. Further Kant argues that these emotions are not based on real experiences as in the experience of actual danger our feeling are very different from the sublime experiences. This line of Kan&rsquo;t enquiry brings us back to how Heidegger (1966) sees this experience as technological thinking. Calculative thinking was a requirement and pillar of Fordism and Taylorism, where information was the building block of automating and making processes predictable and repeatable. Webster (2014, pp. 74&ndash;105) identifies key features about the era that we identify as Fordist-Keynesian era (1945-73). This period consists of developing systems and techniques to increase production and consumption at large scale. Large factories with hundreds and thousands of employees were a common manufacturing practice of this era. This enterprise that reached its peak during fifties and early sixties in parallel developed another trend which was mass consumption fuelled by the high percentage of employment (2 per cent unemployment in Britain) and advertising industries. Whilst there are large scale manufacturing example prior and post this era for example the Manhattan project that had over three hundred thousands of works, scholars and technicians to develop the atomic bomb. What can be traced in most of these is standardization and complex organization. There are much discussions and theories trying to make sense and understand various aspects of this period, however the main purpose of this historical journey is to discuss and find some key characteristics which can help towards understanding and finding threads that shaped and reshaping the world that we live in today. During 1970s a new trend began to emerge under the umbrella of globalisation. &ldquo;it signals the growing interdependence and interpenetration of human relations alongside the increasing integration of the world&rsquo;s socio-economic life&hellip; an explosive growth of migration, tourism, hybrid musical forms and heightened concern for global political strategies&hellip;&rdquo; (Webster, 2014, p. 77). Thrift (Thrift et al., 2014, p. 8) defines globalization as an assemblage of practices to manage and solve the problems of &ldquo;propinquity&rdquo; and &ldquo;credibility&rdquo;. According to Webster the globalization is a continuing enterprise that requires several infrastructural transformations. 1) globalization of the market: this means wider reach of customers worldwide, more competition as well as complex infrastructure of communication and transport. Ian Cook over the past two decades developed a peer reviewed online library of case studies (Cook, 2018) of consumer products emphasizing and showing their social relations and ethics of production. For example Cooks (2004) shows the complex network food industry through following a Jamaican papaya from its farm, network of export and importers, the financial derivatives to the supermarket shelves and into consumer homes and consumer culture developed around thing object. In the beginning of twentieth century, transatlantic cables provided the infrastructure that allowed a transaction to be made within 5 minutes. A similar transaction is now under development that can transfer information between London in New York within 60 milliseconds. The networks of trade and globalization has always existed and it is arguably as old as civilization. Archaeological works shows &ldquo;&hellip;northern Europe was hyper-connected through networks of trade as early as Bronze and Iron Ages, through the spice route to the Roman Empire, through the vagaries of the Chinese or Venetian empires, through the rise of Atlantic economy&hellip;&rdquo;(Thrift et al., 2014, p. 10). The complex logistical and infrastructural changes through globalization should not be only seen through the financial lens, nevertheless its traces can be found both macro and micro practices. (Thrift et al., 2014).</p>

<p>Harman (2011) provides a detailed account of Heidegger&rsquo;s analysis of tools or tool-being (Zuhandenheit), he goes as far as suggesting that majority of historians and scholars who interpret Heidegger were misled by his binary, in-depth playful analysis of the same topic through a complex journey of words and language. Harman offers a new insight into not Heidegger&rsquo;s philosophy but into himself and his concerns. What Harman proposes is a philosophy based on what Heidegger initiated an &ldquo;object oriented philosophy&rdquo; (2011, p. 20). Fry emphasis on the importance of this lines of enquiry and philosophical investigation &ldquo;It is crystal clear that neither the weary humanism, the complacent scientism of lingering Enlightenment, nor posthumanist pluralist postmodernism (with its anti-foundationalism) can provide the intellectual blood, sweat and tools to deal with this situation.&rdquo; (2006, p. 22).</p>

<p>Techne is &ldquo;&hellip;denotes neither art nor technology but a knowledge, the ability to plan and organize freely, to masterinstitutions (cf. Plato\&rsquo;s Phaedrus). Technê is creating, building in the sense of a deliberate pro-ducing.&rdquo; (Heidegger, 1961, p. 11), &ldquo;tekhnb (an art, a reflected system of practices referring to general principles, notions, and concepts&rdquo; (Foucault, 2005, p. 249)</p>

<p>Need to write about second and third wave. Second wave post great war and third more recent with people like Harraway&hellip;</p>

<p>Winner (1980) calls for more holistic study of technology and to look at technology through a combination of these approaches. Scholars who suggest technologies are politically neutral and it is the societies who use them in certain ways whilst they contribute towards the development of knowledge and understanding of how societies use technologies, however they fail to consider the conditions that those software and hardware were produced in. MacKenzie (1999) states that whilst technological determinism brings our attention to some important questions and considerations when dealing with technology, however they fail to generate a reciprocal relationship between society and technology, so instead of society shaping technological changes, they would only have a passive role of adapting to these changes. Since technology is directly or indirectly affecting every aspects of our life and society it is important to develop a firm understanding of technological change and how it is shaped and formed within our societies.</p>

<p>One popular explanation of what shapes technology is the view that suggest technology is shaped and formed based on scientific discoveries and explorations.</p>

<h2 id="ii-enumeration-simplification-and-universalism">II. Enumeration, simplification and universalism</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Every state happy or unhappy, was statistical in its own way.&rdquo; (Scott, 1998, p.16)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enumerate&rdquo; is defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary (&ldquo;Definition of ENUMERATE,&rdquo; 2018) as &ldquo;to ascertain the number of: count&rdquo; or &ldquo;to specify one after another: list&rdquo;. In this chapter I argue that the institutions of liberal democracies are reducing society into categorized, simplified, and reductive individuals. James C. Scott (Scott, 1998, p.184) calls this the &ldquo;civilizing process&rdquo; or &ldquo;domestication&rdquo;, which has three sub-processes: &ldquo;sedentarization&rdquo;, &ldquo;concentration&rdquo; and &ldquo;radical simplification&rdquo;. Although sedentarization is outside of the scope of this chapter (see: Urry, 2004; Cresswell, 1993; Adams, 1999), the other two sub-processes will be discussed in this section.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Legibility is a condition of manipulation. Any substantial state intervention in society &hellip; requires the invention of units that are visible. The units in question might be citizens, villages, trees, fields, houses, or people grouped according to age, depending on the type of intervention&rdquo;</em> (Scott, 1998, p.183)</p>

<p>Charles Babbage writing in 1832 noted the importance of collecting numbers, calling it &ldquo;the constants of Nature and of Art&rdquo; (Babbage, 1832). His idea was to summon the list of all facts that could be expressed in mere numbers. This dream, however wasn\&rsquo;t a dream started by Babbage, for its roots goes far back before even when Comte coined the term positivism. Equally, around 1685 both Leibniz in Prussia and Petty in England made recommendations about creating statistical centres that would collect data about the population allowing the state to foresee the future and measure its power. State-based statistics was a process originally aimed at measuring colonies rather than home, however, it became the practice of the state both internally and externally as best described by Hacking (1990, p.16): &ldquo;Every state happy or unhappy, was statistical in its own way.&rdquo; Further to this Scott (1998) emphasizes the notion of unambiguous identification as one of the main strategies of state power over the last two hundred years. He follows the traces of these strategies not only in the administration of nature such as the German engineering of forests, or the development of new beehives, but also in identification of their residents.</p>

<p>Again, this become normalized to the extent that the notion of surnames as modes of identification has become so embedded in everyday life that it is almost taken as <em>a priori</em>. Traditionally, surnames names were primarily a form of identification based on local knowledge: for example, as Scott notes, in England if there were multiple Johns, then locational or occupational clues would be used to reduce ambiguity. For instance, John Hill referring to John who lives on the Hill, or John Mills, John who owned a mill.[^2] Foucault\&rsquo;s conception of biopolitics and anatomopolitics is described by Hacking as the statistical establishment of the last three hundred years. We see the biopolitical starting around 1763 under the reign of Fredrich the Great for the purpose of restoring and managing the vanished population after seven years of war. This process then continues and gave birth in the next hundred years to centralized institutions specialized in collecting, creating and analysing numbers about people and things, as described by Hacking (1990, p.34): &ldquo;The institutions brought a new kind of man into being, the man whose essence was plotted by a thousand numbers&rdquo;. Using one of Scott&rsquo;s (1998, p.4) four elements of the birth of the modern state, the measurement of the subject by enumeration is the &ldquo;administrative ordering of nature and society&rdquo;. Critically the process of ordered gridding of the social becomes embedded in the fabric of everyday life to the extent that essence and appearance become interchangeable. The other three elements contributing to the birth of modern states are high modernist ideology, which is a by-product of science and technology &ldquo;progress&rdquo;, emergency powers that sprang up at difficult times such as war and famine which gives them unquestionable power to initiate utopian/heterotopian ideas and social engineering projects and lastly weak citizen mobilisation, engagement and power.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;The existence of French men and women around 1790 was made miserable by, among other things, 700 or 800 differently named measures and untold units of the same name but different sizes. A \&rdquo;</em><em>pinte\&ldquo; in Paris came to 0.93 liter; in Saint-Denis, to 1.46; in Seine-en-Montagne, to 1.99; in Précy-sous-Thil, to 3.33. The aune, a unit of length, was still more prolific: Paris had three&rdquo;</em> (Frängsmyr et al., 1990, p.207)</p>

<p>The above quote is an example of local knowledge forms, and their commensurability depending on where, and how, and which community is subjected to them. There is also a trace of universalism in the description of these measurements and the coming need to standardize them. Scott (1998, p.254) documented this process of standardization by looking at the political-aesthetics of modernism: he discusses the visual and aesthetic aspects of high modernist approaches in Ethiopian, Romanian and Tanzanian &#39;villagization&rsquo;. This is a prominent aspect and process that many communities faced during the forced transformation from &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; to &ldquo;modern&rdquo; aesthetics. The primitive was seen as more &ldquo;irregular, dispersed, complicated, unmechanised&rdquo; as opposed to the modern which was &ldquo;tidy, rectilinear, uniform, concentrated, simplified, mechanized&rdquo;. For Scott &ldquo;many state activities aim at transforming the population, space, and nature under their jurisdiction into the closed systems that offer no surprises and that can best be observed and controlled&rdquo; (1998, p.82). The question of control through cartographic vision and surveillance is a significant aspect of Scott&rsquo;s work on the modern state&rsquo;s attempt to make the natural and social world <em>legible,</em> that is readable and knowable. Fundamentally this involves a concentration of vision, or as Scott sees it, a &ldquo;narrowing of the field of vision&rdquo; (1998, p.13), resulting in the delimitation of a field of knowledge that brackets-off or narrows complexity through spatial, temporal and epistemological regimentation and gridding. This process of making legible implies a set of representational mechanisms such as the cadastral map, censuses and &ldquo;standardized units of measurement&rdquo; (Scott, 1998, p.77) all designed to hold meaning, and the natural and social worlds stable. Such mechanisms of making the world legible not only concern how the world was viewed, but also how it was produced and appropriated.</p>

<p>Such processes, in place since the beginning of the 16th century, have been responsible for dramatic changes in the government and management of life, both from individual and national perspectives (Hacking, 1990). Science and technology were central engines to these changes through both methodological and technological approaches towards truth and determinism (Gibbons et al., 1994). This was the creation of the problematic space of universalism, whose ultimate goal was the simplification of the complexity and multiplicity of localized practices. Hacking (1990, p.11) describes these universalistic approaches as the birth of &ldquo;objective knowledge&rdquo; or in Porterian (1996, p.46) terms the &ldquo;social technology&rdquo; of quantification&mdash;a form of knowledge based on statistical modelling. Objective knowledge was born through two key movements, firstly, the discovery that the world is not deterministic, and secondly, the transformation of society and people into mere number. These two changes have created four successful effects on the society: metaphysical, epistemological, logical and ethical. In all four categories Hacking (1990) traces the imperialism of probabilities. The success of these categories is ultimately proven by the fact that they have profoundly altered the direction and perception of society.</p>

<p>One would expect the relationship between indeterminism and statistics to be an opposing equation, however it is the opposite: the recognition of indeterminism results in greater statistical control. This is evidenced by the exponential growth of enumeration in both the physical and natural sciences: the mass publication of numbers and statistics; annual reports; population enumerations such as life span, death rates;[^3] and health measurements. On the other hand, these mere simplifications do not only remain as numbers or statistics, rather they turn into policies, politics, and affective emotions, ultimately creating a social realm in which we live under the shadow of numbers.[^4]</p>

<h3 id="ii-ii-what-do-we-loose-through-enumeration-and-economical-development">II.II. What do we loose through enumeration and economical development</h3>

<p><em>&ldquo;Market culture undermines traditional communities wherever it penetrates &ndash; just as it has undermined community on its home turf for the last four hundred years&rdquo;</em>(Marglin, 2008, p.246)</p>

<p>Marglin (2008, p.245) believes that since the last decades of 15^th^ century (beginning of the age of western exploration) imperialism, development, and globalisation were the three inter linked prominent ingredients of West meeting the rest of the world. In the previous sections I have shown the relationship between enumerations, simplification and universalism and how enumeration is the technology of governance. This section I will draw an image of some of the intended and unintended consequences of such practices. I would like to start this section by a story from development of sports wear in China.</p>

<p>Athletic shoes is the US is a \$15 billion industry with about 107 million pairs being bought for children in America (The Washington Post, 2002, p.4), Marglin (2008, p.228) goes further into the details of production and supply chain:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;An \$80 pair of sneakers includes perhaps \$3.00 of wages for a worker in China, South or Southeast Asia, or the Caribbean &ndash; less than 4% of the total price. The rest is materials (say \$11), rent and other operating costs of the factory owner (another \$3), and the profits of factory owner (another \$2 or so). All this brings the cost to Nike &hellip; to \$18.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>In this case study, one can see a large profit and income inequity between the Eastern manufacturers and Western brands and distributers. Another hidden element here is the distance and a sense of disconnection that this enumeration brings into globalised and international relations between different actors of supply and demand chains. Neither the \$3 wages nor the \$80 product price is showing the atrocities and struggles that human and non human actors endeavour in order for an American child to wear a sports shoes. This is what Marglin (2008, p.238) calls &ldquo;Conventional wage&rdquo;. Conventional wage is the calculation of wages based on the producing countries and opportunities available to them rather than humane solidarity with those in direct affect. This disconnection and imperialism has many branches, another one of the prominent concerning aspect of globalisation is destruction of cultures. Marglin definition of culture is close to what I have traced in this chapter about situated knowledge forms. For Marglin (2008, p.245), culture is a form of &ldquo;&hellip;shared participation in producing and exchanging goods and services; about governing, entertaining, and mourning; and about generating and regenerating people physically, morally and spiritually.&rdquo; &hellip;..</p>

<p>Just as Hacking (1990) argued that enumeration and statistics was a technology that has been used in colonies, it then later on became a technology for governing their own population, another technology of colonisers were imperialism and vanishing non-western cultures which then gave birth to globalisation which also universalised culture both in the new worlds and back at home in Europe. This created a sense of &ldquo;imagined community&rdquo; as Marglin labeled it (2008). After all of these counting and justifying the negativities of enumeration and globalisation, it is important also to remember their positive aspects in order to seek out commensurable solutions and think openly about solutions to these complex and multifaceted problems of universalism and reduction of cultures and communities. If we partially agree that globalisation and enumeration also have positive elements then the central question here would be &ldquo;how we as a community, designers, technologists and scientists would position ourselves in the spectrum between community and globalisation, between deliberation and consensus, between participation and representation?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="iii-governmentality-or-science-of-objectification">III. Governmentality or science of objectification</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;Social power of a collective is a function of the distribution of knowledge over the collective&rdquo;</em> (Bellamy, 1993, p.211)</p>

<p>Foucault in mid 70s published two major works: Discipline and Punish (Foucault, 1991) and History of Sexuality (Foucault, 1984; Foucault, 1992; Foucault, 1990). The former work were more concerned with the role of body and soul as the locus for the practice of power, the move from traditional forms of torture to newer forms. In that work Foucault emphasised 4 guidelines in the study of power:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Study of punitive mechanisms has to look both at punitive mechanisms on their &ldquo;repressive&rdquo; as well as possible positive effects. For instance punishment then would be regarded as a complex social function.</p></li>
<li><p>Punitive methods should not be considered simply as a causation of legislation but also as specialised techniques or in Foucault\&lsquo;s words political tactic.</p></li>
<li><p>History of penal law and human sciences may derive from same source a single process of &ldquo;epistemologico-juridical&rdquo; formation; in short, Foucault believe that technology of power should be one of the prominent principles of both study of the humanization of the penal system and of the knowledge of man.</p></li>
<li><p>In short, punitive methods should be studied as a history of power relations and object relations. (Foucault, 1991)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of the works mentioned above concerned with the importance of keeping an analytical eye on the exercise of power as not just a negative or repressive force, but also their metamorphosis. What Foucault showed through these two works was complex reciprocal relations between the political investment of the body and its economical use. From mid seventies, Foucault took on the task of developing his new theoretical framework of analysing power and he coined two prominent terms &ldquo;Power/Knowledge&rdquo; (Rouse, 2003, p.105) and &ldquo;Governmentality&rdquo; (Foucault et al., 1991, p.102). As shown in section 1 of this chapter, What Foucault and other scholars traced, was the transformation of the technologies of government from mid sixteenth century onwards. A move from &ldquo;multitude of treatises presented as advice to the prince&rdquo; to &ldquo;art of government&rdquo; (Foucault et al., 1991, p.87). The former is not the concern of this thesis, therefor the focus will be from 16^th^ century onwards. Art of government started to form shape initially in the sixteenth century with questions concerned with government of oneself which developed approaches such as stoicism. Also problematics of governing lives and souls which was the locus of Catholic and Protestant doctrine. The list continues with the government of children, pedagogy, health and so on. These concerns and processes, gave birth to the death of feudalism, and rise of establishments, imperialism and colonial states. An interesting change here is the domain and use of law itself, from being a punitive and instrument of sovereignty to becoming a guiding technology. Law traditionally was an instrument for the common good, something all subjects would obey without exception as long as the law was in accordance with the laws of the master or the king or God the the ultimate sovereignty. Through the transformations of the 17^th^ century, however law then became one of the tactics of governance. The idea of economy as the government of the family and how art of government becoming a series of interventions and complex processes formed through use of numbers, laws, legislations, sovereignty and other technologies of government. Instead of government being about sovereignty of the prince over a territory it became about meeting ends and specific certitudes. (Foucault et al., 1991)</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Wisdom, understood no longer in the traditional sense as knowledge of divine and human laws, of justice and equality, but rather as the knowledge of things, of the objectives that can and should be attained, and the disposition of things required to reach them; it is this knowledge that is to constitute the wisdom of the sovereign.&rdquo;(Foucault et al., 1991, p.96)</em></p>

<p>It is useful to also mention a text referred to by Foucault: Le miroir politique from 1555 (Dexter, 1955) where La Perrière defined government as &ldquo;the right disposition of things, arranged so as to lead to a convenient end&rdquo;. Some examples of convenient ends (programs) could be, reproduction, expansion of territories and improvement of health. This text by La Perriere, marks the beginning of the transformations mentioned earlier. So government becomes about right disposition of things. It is important to understand, in this analysis the relationship between government and &ldquo;body politic&rdquo; (Hobbes &amp; Curley, 1994, p.146) is not a top down one, but a multifaceted network of technologies and tactics to achieve finalities. Through the development of science of governing, we have shown that economy became central again, however now on a different axis and plane. <em>&ldquo;The constitution of a savoir of government is absolutely inseparable from that of a knowledge of all the processes related to population in Its larger sense: that is to say, what we now call the economy&rdquo;</em> (Foucault et al., 1991, p.100). Economy and statistics from being a technology in the hands feudals, it is becoming a form of &ldquo;savoir&rdquo; concerned with all aspects of &ldquo;body politic&rdquo;. It is crucial not to misunderstand the analytical framework here by assuming that sovereignty is being replaced by disciplined society and discipline by art of government. Instead there is a triangular relationship between these three elements: Government, discipline and sovereignty. This triangle gave birth to a new problematic space called population, or in Habermasian terms: &ldquo;wild life&rdquo; which is a space &ldquo;a field of intervention and an objective of governmental techniques&rdquo; or &ldquo;governmentality&rdquo; (Foucault et al., 1991, p.102). The move from feudal territorial regime (Laws: amalgamation of obligation and litigation) to administrative state (National boundaries, discipline and regulation) to governmental state was not directed by an &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo; (Smith, 1930, p.288), but through a reciprocal net-work of actors such as science, technology, statistics and new problematic spaces creating, changing and mediating one another. This is the important lesson and analytical technique to take from foucaudian studies of power. What was important to Foucault was not only the forms of knowledge being produced, but how and through what techniques they would become authoritative and intelligable. This approach to power would allow us to develop a better understanding of why and how our financial system is the way it is today and how we can develop ways to engage with it, scrutinise and understand it?</p>

<p>Howells defined knowledge as &ldquo;Knowledge can be defined as a dynamic framework or structure from which information can be stored, processed and understood.&rdquo;(Howells, 2002, p.872). What should be remembered here from what we have discussed earlier is Who stored the knowledge, who process it, How it has been processed? and for the understanding of whom? Jasanoff discusses the implications of the techniques that governments developed to control and legislate knowledge production through some quantified measures which she calls technologies of hubris. The purpose of these technologies is to provide confidence and certainty within the society, as oppose to technologies of humility which they are about bringing doubt and uncertainty. (Newell, 2012; Jasanoff, 2005)</p>

<p>In previous sections, we discussed some of the un/intented consequences of technological advancements and enumeration. Bill Joy, one of the chief scientinst at Sun Microsystems raises an important point about technological advancements, which is their unquestioned acceptance in society. How quickly we familiarise ourselves with them, which brings in the next problematic which is how much our modern institutions are concerned with these technological dizziness in order to reduce the damages incured as part of the process of &ldquo;progress&rdquo;. Whilst this advancements offer some benefits, they can not at the same time protect us from the damages caused by technological advancements(Jasanoff, 2005; Lewis, 2015). Another un/intended bi-products of &ldquo;power/knowledge&rdquo; practices of modern democratic regimes is the birth of centres and fragmented public of experts. For Jasanoff <em>&ldquo;The issue, in other words, is no longer whether the public should have a say in technical decisions, but how to promote more meaningful interaction among policy-makers, scientific experts, corporate producers, and the public&rdquo;</em> (2005, p.238). Jasanoff states, the prominent issue we are facing in modern societies is how to live within a democratic context in peace whilst having the knowledge that we are inevitably at risk. This technological dizziness arguably can be managed at least from two perspectives, one is from the political dimension of science and technology and their relationship to society. And the other is about openness of technology firms and scientists about the intended and unintended consequences of such tools. Nowtony (2001) emphasis on the importance of reconnecting the knowledgable publics to the technological and scientific production process as they were traditionally excluded. For Nowtony participaotry methods can be agrued as some of the recent remedies for this issue, for instance citizen juries, consensus conferences, and referenda. Gibbons also emphasises on this very similar problem, but offers a different approach which is about introducing more transparency and regulation on science as the prominent mode of knowledge production (Gibbons et al., 1994). Jasanoff argues the main question that seeks our attention to connect these fragmented publics of experts, policy-makers, scientists and the general public should be &ldquo;how to promote more meaningful interaction&hellip;&rdquo;. Interstingly the terminology used to describe these publics[^5] is another example of these exclusions (i.e. publics from knowledge production pipelines). Further Jasanoff discusses the implications of the techniques that governments developed to control and legislate knowledge production through some quantified measures which she calles technologies of hubris, the purpose of these technologies is to provide confidence and certainty within the society, as oppose to technologies of humility which they are about bringing doubt and uncertainty (Newell, 2012; Jasanoff, 2005). Jasanoff calles these technologies of hubris, predictive methods, which are about giving more attention to short-term risks rather than long-term, undetermined ones. Rose (1991) shows the relationship between quantification and democratic government or on the other hand democratic power and calculating power. He categorises enumerations into four groups: Numerical calculations of minorities and majorities, linking governments with governed such as opinion polls, authoritative power over national life: balance in payments, growth national product, and lastly governing calculations: tax returns, counts of population. Rose goes on into discussing how these enumerations could be used as political &ldquo;social technologies&rdquo;, which is the very same track traced by other scholars in many other disciplines such as (ADD AGRICULTURE, STS, &hellip;).</p>

<p>Technologies of the hubris or &ldquo;administrative ordering of nature and society&rdquo; according to Scot (Scott, 1998, p.4) is one of the four elements that contributes to the birth of modern states that tend to create large scale organised systems, cities, grids and states. The next three elements are high modernist ideology, which is a by-product of science and technology &ldquo;progress&rdquo;, emergency powers that sprang up at difficult times such as war, famine and so on which gives them unquestionable power to initiate utopian ideas and social engineering projects and lastly weak citizen mobilisation, engagement and power (Scott, 1998). If we persue with the same expert knowledge production techniques, humanities and social researchers have the important role of deliberating and bringing some of these long terms disastrerous effects of sicence and technology into the locus of general public, however as mentioned earlier, we are also dealing with a society who quickly adapts and accpets unknown changes, which results in a fast pace of technological advancements a condition that Lindblom () calles &ldquo;all thumbs and no fingers&rdquo;, with anthropologists, socialogists and social researchers out of breath left behind in the &ldquo;field&rdquo;. This even makes it more important for a new sets of technologies as Jasanoff calles them &ldquo;technologies of humility&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="iv-overview-on-knowledge-and-information">IV. Overview on Knowledge and information</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;But with the repression of political life in the land as a whole, &hellip;without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element. Public life gradually falls asleep, a few dozen party leaders of inexhaustible energy and boundless experience direct and rule.&rdquo;</em>(Luxemburg, 1992, p.72)</p>

<p>Polanyi defines two types of knowledge, tacit and explicit. Explicit is when there is no need to experience the knowledge directly and it can be reproduced through use of mediums, for instance language. Tacit knowledge as polanyi calles it &ldquo;subception&rdquo; is a form of knowledge that can not be codified, and it is through a learned experience for instance the craft knowledge, however some believe that this can be learned through codification. Howells (2002) suggest that based on looking at knowledge spillover studies, &ldquo;tacit knowledge, situation and locational context&rdquo; are prominent element in the process of knowledge distribution. Another characteristic of knowledge is accessibility, Howells (2002) categorises knowledge into postriori and priori knowledge. Posteriori is something that can be purchased and Priori is something that acquired through contracts R&amp;D and research agreements according. There is also another strategy to acquire knowledge which is employing knowledge labour directy (i.e. scientists, researchers and so on).</p>

<p>The main purpose of these methods are to bring into attention the long term, intended and unintended consequences of new developments. This can be followed from four perspectives as Jasanoff argues, framing analysis, vulnerability, distribution and learning.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>&ldquo;To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated, regimented, closed in, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, assessed, evaluated, censored, commanded; all by creatures that have neither the right, nor wisdom, nor virtue&hellip; . To be governed means that at every move, operation, or transaction one is noted, registered, entered in a census, taxed, stamped, priced, assessed, patented, licensed, authorized, recommended, admonished, prevented, reformed, set right, corrected.&rdquo;(Chomsky, 2003, p.17)</em></p>

<p>Bhagwati (2007) one of the defenders of the globalisation, provides wide range of reasons to why globalisation is a positive force and it should be supported and inforced further, however he fails to justify his claims and he does not provide evidence to his claims. As shown in this chapter whilst I do no agree with Bhagwati\&rsquo;s point about speeding up free market processes, I do agree that it is important to avoid completely crossing out some of the benefits that technological advancement brought into our lives. For example infant death rate has been significantly reduced through modern medicine and technological advancement, as well as many other health improvements, travel affordances, access to information through the internet and so on. The position that this thesis has however is a reconciling one. Scot (1998, p.311) argues that high modernism is in continues struggle with local knowledge. This is often through use of science as a dominant and imperial view which then called other forms of practical knowledge something between superstitions and insignificant. Scott (1998) suggests that, the high modernist manifestations have not fully instructed in our societies due to three factors, citizens private sphere of acting within the society, free market and lastly existence of labour and independent institutions like the unions that they resisted some of the changes that the establishments planned to initiate. Jacob (1992, p.32) argues that the &ldquo;public peace&rdquo; becomes possible not through the force of police, architectural planning, but through a &ldquo;network of voluntarily controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we refer to all dynamic, practical knowledge forms as metis, looking at some complex human interactions shows the complexity of acuiring metis, for example a boxer who needs to learn many automatic responses to opponents moves through practice, this shows the fact that the essential part of acquiring metis is the experience itself (Scott, 1998, p.315). Acquiring metis that can be tranformed into action is a big challenge as the channels and methods to acquire any knowledge about the consequences of intitutional practices is through eighter biased media or through complicated channels of knowledge acquiring which requires much experience and specialisation. An evidence to this point is the fact that there are hundreds of organisations being specialist as puzzle makers who put the dispersed information togethwer to develop an image of an organisaiton, like corporatewatch, IRIS, Ethical screening as so on.</p>

<p>So the cruicial question to consider is:</p>

<p>How design can foster a new relationship with technology, a relationship that can offer a commensurable space for communities to take advantage of technology. Technologies that support community practices and their actor-hood and not technologies who support certain actor-hood that fits into the categorised and simplified communities of the googles and facebooks.</p>

<p>Next chapter will look at Knowledge forms available within Britain about the financial sector, who produce them and their relationship with gevening technologies of British governement. Only after these two analysis we will be able to think about ways that can offer new techniques of citizen participation and deliberation which will be the focus of chapter 3.</p>
