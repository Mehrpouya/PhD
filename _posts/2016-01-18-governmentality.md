#Rose, N. (1991) Governing by numbers: Figuring out democracy. Accounting, organizations and society, 16 (7), pp.673â€“692.

The essay looks at the relationship between quantification and democratic government or the relationship between democratic power and calculated power. Rose started his argument by first categorising the use of numbers into 4 classifications:
- Numerical calculations of majorities and minorities
- Numerical calculations linking governments with the lives of the governed such as opinion polls
- Numerical calculations based on authoritative powers over national life, such as balance in payments, gross national product...
- Numerical calculations for governing: tax returns, counts of population.
