#Intro

The original purpose of my [PhD][phd] was to study the following:

- How digital technologies are transforming community narratives into the digital sphere (For example see, Knoydart community's [energy consumption visualisation][knoydart-vis]).
- How these digital spheres and spaces are being used by the community.
- How these approaches to heterogeneous and non-hegemonic modes of development, innovation and production could effect design.

The study aimed to specifically focus on "off grid" communities.

My PhD is practice based and therefore to follow these questions, I did four pilot studies to gain better understanding of the "whats" first.

For example:

- What is a grid?
- What is off grid?
- What is a community?
- What does it mean to be responsible in the context of selected (Knoydart, Isle of Eigg and Gaza strip) off grid communities?

During the first year of my research I developed 4 interventions within different contexts, each of them designed and developed with different aims to explore the main questions.

The four interventions are as follows:

- **Eigg mobility**: Literature review on mobility turn, ethnographic methods, auto ethnography, video ethnography, interview techniques.  
- **Power of Knoydart**: Research through design, Action Research
- **Zaytoun**: digital data, data visualisation and issues of localisation and materialising information
- **Personal Grids**: quantified self, study of personal grids

#Research process:

talk about practice based research and mixed methods



I will first describe very briefly the concept and purpose of each work and then explain each work individually in their separate section. Each individual project also includes a brief literature review around its topic.

##Eigg mobility:

Eigg mobility was a follow on project on Isle of eigg to look at behaviour change and community perception of mobility on the island, from pragmatists and historical point of views.

In Summer 2014 [Eco Travel Network(ETN)][ETN] - a limited company based in Wales – founded by Alison Kidd and Peter Williams, started a [2 month trial][etn-trial] of the [Renault Twizy][Renault Twizy] on Isle of Eigg as an alternative low carbon road transport.

![This is how Twizy looks like](/images/twizy.jpg)

The vehicle has been equipped with a GPS device in order to record its movements and use on Eigg. In addition to this ETN also used diary research method to collect some qualitative measures from each family using the car for a period of one week.

I made a rough visualisation of about one month of collected data using Cartodb platform. Thanks to [Off Grid project](http://lifeoffthegrid.net/) and in Particular [Alice Street](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/alice_street) and [Jamie Cross](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/cross_jamie) from Anthropology department, University of Edinburgh for the opportunity and providing me with access to their Cartodb subscription.

The primary aim of ETN in this trial is to find ways to make individuals linking between personal travel and energy. this research requires mix of methods and approaches to develop a way to entangle some of the complexities around linking community, mobility and energy. I will be using mix of ethnography methods during this 10 days, interviews, mobile methods: giving a lift to people on Eigg and using gopro and microphone to record some of the conversations and the experice of driving the car and journey, photography and at the end a feedback session in collaboration with Eco Travel Network including all fifteen families who used Twizy.

##Power of Knoydart:

##Zaytoun:

##Personal grid:





The four interventions are the work that I have done on two "off grid" communities in the West Coast of Scotland. The thirst intervention was an art work called Zaytoun and finaly a person grid study.
First I will provide a brief explanation of the concept of each work and then explain each individual work in more detail. The conclusion section will discuss how all these work is pieced together through my PhD and the planning section will provide the next steps of my PhD.





#Knoydart
Knoydart a peninsula located in west coast of Scotland. Knoydart is another off grid community based in the UK. Knoydart energy [Knoydart renewables] operated on a micro hydro-electric and is completely off national electricity grid.
##Rationale
In september 2014 University of Edinburgh in Collaboration with Knoydart Foundation, Community Energy Scotland and Local Energy Scotland, started a research project around Knoydart renewable energy and ways to expand and explore community needs and understanding of it.
This opportunity provided a great

##Methodology:

research through design

##Abstract:

First phase:

Over the past couple of years Knoydart Foundation slowly developed and explored ways to use digital technologies in order to introduce and implement more advanced ways to monitor, sustain and improve their infrastructure and its relation to the community. One of the developments during this time, was adding a DT80LM3 data taker at the starting point of their electricity grid. The datataker currently stores rainfall and dam level, energy production and consumption. The initial phase of this project involved setting up the tracker and connecting it to the hydro system, and an initial data visualisation showing the recorded energy data.

The challenge that Knoydart Foundation and the community were facing was very different from what people connected to national grid would experience. Knoydart produces one of the cleanest and renewable energy in the UK while facing various challenges such as cost of maintaining the infrastructure, daily maintenance routines, load balance and so on. Currently in ideal scenario because of their energy production limits, twice or three time during the year they will have power cuts due to sudden spikes in energy use, for instance during Christmas holiday. This is not including other uncontrollable incidents such as when there is a power cut due to weather conditions (For example: lightning). Rest of the time the community is producing more energy than they can consume and this bring a big area of potentials to develop new projects using cheap, clean and renewable energy. on the other hand there is no continuous flow of government fund or other forms of fund for sustaining and investing in Knoydart, so the dilemma here is how to encourage residents to use more electricity while developing general consensus within the community about brainstorming and thinking new ways of using the extra overhead.

Design process:

In order to develop a better understanding of different residents thoughts on their energy grid, its potentials and issues, we first had a few meeting with some members of the Knoydart and Forestry Foundations about their ideas and needs. The first of these meetings happened on the day we arrived in Knoydart and the discussion continued with to of the partners until later in the evening.
After a brief introduction about different and similar aims of each of the 4 partners. For instance from Knoydart Foundation point of view while being at the heart of the community in Knoydart it is still important to not to let the worries and issues facing the energy infrastructure directly facing the community considering the size of the community and how it can easily damages the relationships between different parts. So results of our design needs to play a very careful role in terms of connecting energy use, potential futures and relationship with these organisations.
Another important element to consider is the dangers of data surveillance and how it can produce blame based approaches and difficulties within the community.

Sometime communicating with smaller communities like Knoydart seems like an ideal and easy way to do participative design, however in reality this relationship as well as any other community based work is very complicated and difficult to manage and sustain in a meaningful way.

After our first meeting we decided to develop a series of prototypes to engage the community in thinking and designing with us, this was through improving the data connection, and developing 5 new visualisation based on our understanding of the current ideas and things the community were considering.

The main areas of concern were:
How to encourage residents to use more electricity
What are the new ways that Knoydart can invests its energy overhead in new projects
While encouraging residents to consume more and feel safe about their energy infrastructure how to develop a sense of responsibility and awareness about the fragility of the energy infrastructure.


START FROM HERE:

Our initial prototype involved 5 visualisations, converting digital data about energy use and consumption into potential projects for the future, for example figure 1 is showing how many new homes could be heated with the extra energy available in Knoydart grid and figure two is showing how many return boat journeys to Mallaig could be done with an electric boat being charged using Knoydart electricity grid energy overhead.
While trying to introduce methods and design interruptions within Knoydart to encourage residents to consume more energy, electric devices has very different consumption behaviours, for instance kettles tend to use large amounts of electricity in a very short period of time, and on a grid with limited capacity, a big number of these kettles on top of the normal electricity load can lead into power cut, so it is also important to raise awareness on these issues as well.

We tried to continue our conversation with Knoydart Foundation and other partners through these series of visualisations. None of them were planned ahead of our visit and we developed them during our visit.

The development of this project was through 4 major cycles: Communication: Designing interventions and techniques to engage with the community, Observation: looking at how the interventions are untangling some aspects and element of community energy grid and their concerns, Exploration: developing new ways to look at the data working with the community to develop prototypes and new interventions and finally documentation: was about diverging all of our development and delivering the interventions to the community with some analytics and feedback methodologies so they can use them afterwards as a method of investigation and undestanding energy needs and potentials for future development. The thread that connected all these different phases was the digital data.

Data:
Knoydart Foundation uses DT80LM3 datataker to store rainfall, dam level, energy production and consumption of the community. This information helps the Foundation at first instance to predics some of the demand trends of the community so they can develop load balancing strategies while also provide ways for them to be able to predict the income and outgoing of the Foundation in order to sustain and improve their grid.
In addition to this we store a copy of all the data in one of Edinburgh University servers in a relational database using MySQL. The data is being fetched every 10 seconds from the tracker and stored in the MySQL database using a python script. This data is then available through PhP API for other application and reporting purposes that we developed as part of this project.

Communication and Realisation:
During this time we developed our first visualisation of the community data, which was simply a Web 2.0 graph based visualisation. This webpage have been used and tested by a small number of the community and originated some feedback and conversations which helped us to develop the next series of explorations and interventions.



Our first development as part of this project was a simple diagram of all the data using a simple Web 3.0 page, this visualisation have been used by the Knoydart foundation  for instance figure 3 is showing the power capacity of Knoydart in average kettle measures, all the data being retrieved from a mysql database at real time.
our first week visit to Knoydart wrapped up with a focus group and feedback session around our design, which we also tried to use printed version of them to collect feedback about potential future projects.

Implementation:
As shown in figure 2

changes in the design and introduction of data kettle after this focus group

##Introduction:


-------------------

#Zaytoun

Networked journalism, a recent trend through the development of Web 2.0 and 3.0 technologies such as micro-blogging and social media gave birth to a new form of interaction between the traditional notion of journalism and the public (Beckett 2010). The spread of smartphones and Internet to all corners of the world has given individuals a global voice for what they see, hear and observe.

Bradshaw (2012) discusses some of the hidden practices within Data Journalism such as methods that journalists use to filter the data, vast data collection techniques and data mining methods to generate new forms of information from digitised data. The complexity of the practice and issues with data overload in the modern age also brings in concerns about data privileges. For instance, how various kinds of information such as wars, diseases and corruption compete with one another.

The piece ‘Zaytoun’, was created in response to the 50 days war in the Gaza Strip of Occupied Palestine during the summer of 2014. Graphite-based conductive ink on top of an emotive illustration by artist Mina Braun affords the opportunity for direct interaction with the drawing. Touches across the textured surface trigger a change in the capacitance of the circuit, which is detected by the various analogue pins of an Arduino Mega micro controller. When a threshold of electrical current is broken, the program sends text to a pair of thermal receipt printers.

One of the thermal printers prints names of individuals who died during this war and the other prints collected local stories from twitter. The stories included within this work are collected from individuals living inside Gaza strip, Jerusalem and the West Bank, reporting the current crisis. Names of people who lost their lives, during and since the invasion are downloaded periodically from Al-Khabar (Al-Khabar 2014) website which gets the list from Gaza Ministry of Health. In order to capture this data we developed a PHP program that converted and stored it using JSON standard for use within the visualisation.

The illustration consists of families and an olive tree  (see: Mehrpouya, 2014). Olive trees are internationally recognised as a symbol of peace. In Palestine they are also a symbol of unity and the relationship people have with their lands. Not only have the Palestinians been oppressed and forced to give up their lands but also vast numbers of these trees have been bulldozed or moved to occupied lands and inside Israel (See: Khoury 2013, Booth 2014).

The invasion and bombardment of Gaza coincided with the run up to a symposium on the production of data, organised by the research centre for Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Submission of the drawing was not only an opportunity to bring human suffering to the fore in an academic community which can, on occasion, be isolated from the ‘real world’. There was also a desire to preserve the personal nature of the data that major events inevitably generate now.

## Data, Why Twitter?
Everyday over 95 million messages get shared between users and twitter as a mediator of a real-time information network among all of its users (Huberman et al. 2008). This creates a contested space, with various biases and concerns, for instance institutions who are more code-savvy and have an ability to automate and mass produce tweets. Also individuals with specific political agendas who can create various trends and biased information. The twitter system itself also tends to filter the daily 95 million tweets and tailor them to the interests of the user or perhaps the interests of twitter advertisers. This complexity, while providing an area of uncertainty and a blurred reliability (See: Stephanie 2009, Acar & Muraki 2011), in disastrous situations also allows people to communicate in a more meaningful way with the people from outside and inside their countries (for examples see: Acar & Muraki 2011, Heverin & Zach 2010, Vieweg et al. 2010) .

In this piece we needed to collect information about local stories reported by people directly involved in the disaster and solid numbers and figures which turned out to be a very challenging aspect of this work (For example the #gazaunderattack hashtag over the course of recent Israel election in the past week on average had about 6 thousand tweets per day (Topsy 2015)) As has been the case in the past with 24-hour rolling news, the actual persistence of this public content has been relatively flimsy. Stories and photos, unless recirculated in the ‘traditional media’ or archived by individuals, are difficult to track down after the event. One example is the above hashtag. Researchers were able to periodically scrape tweets from the API and saved over 267,000. However, on a recent search there were only some few hundred reported.

##Reflection and Discussion:

Following our installation at University of Edinburgh Producing Data Conference, we made some changes to the collected stories of this piece and also some improvements at interaction level.

We did not collect any qualitative or quantitative data about this piece during its installation at the conference nor its installation at Edinburgh college of art except for the thread of printed paper itself that represents the number of times the drawing has been touched.

Over the course of the two installations we found that use of illustration and art as a way to communicate with digital data and numbers will create a very personal and strong link with the observers. We informally interviewed some of the participants at the Producing Data conference and one individual stated that he “never realised the war was still going on” and the majority of observers found the lengthy prints on receipt paper and personal stories very strong and communicative.

We also found that the majority of people who looked at piece did not touch the illustration for reasons such as being scared of damaging the art work or not understanding the dynamics of the interaction. Over the course of two weeks only 65 individuals touched the illustration. The less formal location for display in the Evolution House building may also have contributed to this somewhat. The only direct feedback in the user experience is the sound of the printers triggering. If this is inaudible it is unclear that a touch was successful. For our exhibition in V&A Digital Futures as Part of pre EVA-London conference we are planning to make the interaction part more clear and collect more qualitative feedback.
