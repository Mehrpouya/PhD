    <h1 id="rose-n-1991-governing-by-numbers-figuring-out-democracy-accounting-organizations-and-society-16-7-pp-673-692">Rose, N. (1991) Governing by numbers: Figuring out democracy. Accounting, organizations and society, 16 (7), pp.673–692.</h1>

<p>The essay looks at the relationship between quantification and democratic government or the relationship between democratic power and calculated power. Rose started his argument by first categorising the use of numbers into 4 classifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numerical calculations of majorities and minorities</li>
<li>Numerical calculations linking governments with the lives of the governed such as opinion polls</li>
<li>Numerical calculations based on authoritative powers over national life, such as balance in payments, gross national product&hellip;</li>
<li>Numerical calculations for governing: tax returns, counts of population.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this was an explanations of &ldquo;numericization of politics&rdquo;, then Rose goes on explaining the &ldquo;politics of numbers&rdquo; (p,674)</p>

<ul>
<li>Politics of accuracy</li>
<li>Politics of adequacy</li>
<li>Politics of use and abuse, &ldquo;elaborated in particular by civil liberties&rdquo;</li>
<li>Politics of privacy, deployed by libertarians.</li>
<li>Politics of ethics, morality of making decisions based on numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rose argues according to Starr and Alonso&rsquo;s work that there is a reciprocal and mutual constitutive relationship between numbers and Politics, In a way they are like map and terrain relationship, they both related to each others reality and creates each others essence and appearance.</p>

<h3 id="rose-39-s-hypothesis">Rose&rsquo;s hypothesis:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There is a constitutive interrelationship between quantification and democratic government. Democratic power is calculated power, and numbers are intrinsic to the forms of justification that give legitimacy to political power in democracies. democratic power is calculating power, and numbers are integral to the technologies that seek to give effect to democracy as a particular set of mechanisms of rule. Democratic power requires citizens who calculate about power, and numeracy and a numericized space of public discourse are essential fore making up self-controlling democratic citizens.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the question would be techniques to identify and study such phenomenons</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and knowledge&rdquo;, this is all Foucault&rsquo;s work</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To governs a domain &ndash; a population, an economy &ndash; has entailed seeking to exercise a power over it that is modulated by a knowledge of its laws, processes and conditions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and information&rdquo;, see more in Pasquale Pasquino&rsquo;s work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There can be no well-ordered political machinery or enlightened administration, they argue, without a knowledge of the state of the population, and the numbering of persons, goods, activities, births, crimes, deaths and much else provides the material on which administrative calculation can operate. (p, 676)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Centres of calculation, for more on this see Latour&rsquo;s works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To exercise power over events and processes distant from oneself it is necessary to turn them into traces that can be mobalised and accumulated. Events must be inscribed in standardized forms, the inscriptions transported from far and wide and accumulated in a central locale, where they can be aggregated, compared, compiled and calculated about.
&hellip;.
Further Rose suggests based on Ian Hacking&rsquo;s argument(1981)
&ldquo;Turning the objects of government into numericized inscriptions, then, enables a machinery of government to operate from centres that calculate.  &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Techniques of inscription and accumulation of facts about &ldquo;the population&rdquo;, the &ldquo;national economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. This renders a visible domain with a certain internal homogeneity and external boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The collections and aggregation of numbers participates in the fabruication of &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; within which thought and action can occur. Numbers here delineate &ldquo;fictive spaces&rdquo; for the operation of government, and establish a &ldquo;plane of reality&rdquo;, marked out by a grid of norms, on which government can operate. (Miller &amp; O&#39;Leary, 1987, Rose, 1988, Miller &amp; Rose, 1990).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Censor</strong> comes from Romans and it meant the person who censed they were in charge of counting people who are good at taxation, military and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> comes from 17th century German notion of a science of states.</p>

<p>Porter 1986, discussed the relationship between statistics and standardisation
Anthony Hopwood</p>

<blockquote>
<p>numbers, and the specialist knowledges and professional techniques associated with them &ldquo;can become implicated in the creation of a domain where technical expertise can come to dominate political debate&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following from Hopwood argument then Rose goes on to look at the analysis of the numericization, Cline Cohen implies that numericization happens because of the &ldquo;ordering capacity&rdquo; of the numbers through
1. &ldquo;Bond of uniformity&rdquo;
2. unlike orders to come together, like weather of London and New York.
3. Numbers can be stabalising, for example velocity can be decomposed to time and distance, population growth to fertility and mortality.
4. Numbers can be used for developing probability and measuring risks.</p>

<h1 id="rose-n-o-malley-p-amp-valverde-m-2006-governmentality-annual-review-of-law-and-social-science-2-pp-83-104">Rose, N., O’Malley, P. &amp; Valverde, M. (2006) Governmentality. Annual review of law and social science, 2, pp.83–104.</h1>

<p>Foucault, defined government in his lectures (Foucault, 2009) as &ldquo;an activity that undertakes to conduct individuals throughout their lives by placing them under the authority of a guide responsible for what they do and for what happens to them.&rdquo;
And as Rose&rsquo;s stated, Foucault in his lecture &ldquo;On the government of the Living&rdquo; defined Governmentality as &ldquo;understood i the broad sense of techniques and procedures for directing human behavior.&rdquo;
In &ldquo;Discipline and punish&rdquo; Foucault brought the idea of reason of state which replaces the older notion of government or art of governing based on traditional virtues such as &ldquo;wisdom, justice, liberality, respect for divine laws of human customs&rdquo; or common abilities &ldquo;prudence, thoughtful decisions, taking care to surround oneself with the best advisor&rdquo;.
Rose et.al suggest then that in the new art of governing, &ldquo;populations had to be understood by means of specific knowledges and to be governed through techniques that are attuned to these emergent understandings&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Liberalism</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Political rationality, a way of doing things that was oriented to specific objectives and that reflected on itself in characteristic ways.&rdquo; from Rose&rsquo;s article on Governmetality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rose&rsquo;s suggests from Foucault&rsquo;s Discipline and Punish that liberalisms is a technology of government in response to the critique of governing regimes being excessive. p3</p>

<p>Very important questions that Rose identified as ways to think and analyse power and governing regimes is to think about these(Think about Foucault&rsquo;s suggesiton about how he analysed formation of liberalism and read this questions):</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify styles of thought</li>
<li>Their conditions of formation</li>
<li>The principles and knowledges that they borrow from and generate</li>
<li>The practices that they consist of</li>
<li>How they are carried out- Their contestations and alliances with other arts of governing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I should think about banks here and their programs, for example About their styles of thought, the idea of credit as liberalism, the knowledge they borrow and produce, Their conditions of formation (Economy and market&hellip;)</p>

<p>Rose&rsquo;s suggests the following set of questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Who or what is to be governed?</li>
<li>To what ends should they be governed?<br>
Governmetality doesn&rsquo;t suggest that there is one body of government out there applying these rules or condition rather many of them working in conjuction for their own objectives and this will result in the following quesitons</li>
<li>Who governs what?</li>
<li>According to what logics?</li>
<li>Wit what techniques?</li>
<li>Toward what ends?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="michel-f-1977-discipline-and-punish-the-birth-of-the-prison-trans-sheridan-a-penguin-books-london">Michel, F. (1977) Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison. Trans. Sheridan A. Penguin Books. London.</h1>

<p>Discipline and Punish consists of four major parts:
- torture: analysis the role of body and the form of the torture itself, or the body and scaffold
- punishment
- discipline
- prison</p>

<p>In this work, Foucault attempts to change and criticises many existing practices of studying and analysing power. This is through looking at power as a network of nodes each exercising power with their own objectives and techniques. This is one of his first works where he introduced the term &ldquo;Governmentality&rdquo;. The focus of this book as the name suggests is primary on the practice of power through discipline and punishment as techniques of governementality. He then in his late 70s lectures, changes parts of his arguments in terms of governmentality and practices of power and orgues that in &ldquo;advanced democratic regimes&rdquo; the power is practiced through other strategies such as liberalism (see Rose et al, 2006).</p>

<h2 id="torture">Torture</h2>

<p>Discipline and punish studies the role of body and soul as the locus for the practice of power, the move from traditional forms of torture to newer forms.
These are four general rules that Foucault stated as his guidlines for this study:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do not concentrate the study of the punitive mechanisms on their &ldquo;repressive&rdquo; effects alone, on their &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; aspects alone, but situate them in a whole series of their possible positive effects, even if these seem marginal at freest sight. as a consequence, regard punishment as a complex social function.</li>
<li>Analyse punitive methods not simple as consequences of legislation or as indicators of social structures, but as techniques possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other ways of exercising power. Regard punishment as a political tactic.</li>
<li>Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing or useful effect, according o one&rsquo;s point of view, see whether there is not some common martix or whether they do not both derive from a single process of &ldquo;epistemologico-juridical&rdquo; formationl; in short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the humanization of the penal system and of the knowledge of man.</li>
<li>In short, try to study the metamorphosis of punitive methods on the basis of a political technology of the body in which might be read a common history of power relations and object relations. (p.23-24)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>He emphasis on the importance of keeping a critical eye on the fact that any exercise of power in this case punitive measures are not just negative and for reasons such as control and repress but also think about their useful effects and what they are trying to support.</p>

<p>He connects the political investment of the body with its economical use through complex reciprocal relations. so from one hand governmentality is a technique to control and dominate the body and subjectification is the strategy to constitude labour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The body becomes a useful force only if it is both a productive body and a subjected body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Foucault there may be a form of knowledge called political <strong>&ldquo;technology of the body&rdquo;</strong> which is not just a knowledge about its functions or forces but rather it is about ways to conquer it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; It cannot be localized in a particular type of institution or state apparatus. (p.26)</p>

<p>Now the study of this micro-physaics presupposes that the power exercised on the body is conceived not as a property, but as a strategy, that its effect of domination are attributed not to &quot;appropriation&rdquo;, but to dispositions, maneuvers, tactics, techniques, functionings; that one should decipher in it a <strong>network of relations</strong>, constantly in tention, in activity, rather than a privilege that one might possess. In short this power is exercised rather than possessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The power does not belong to a class or a specific group, but it gets transmitted in the society by its members through their use of it and their struggles. This form of power also is no univocal, it has many locuses of confrontation and instability with its own risks and conflicts.</p>

<p>So in a way Faoucault is suggesting that there is marxian mediation relation between power and knowledge, like  essence and appearance (For more on the concept of essense see Gunn, 1987).</p>
