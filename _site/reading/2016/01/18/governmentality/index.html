    <h1 id="rose-n-1991-governing-by-numbers-figuring-out-democracy-accounting-organizations-and-society-16-7-pp-673-692">Rose, N. (1991) Governing by numbers: Figuring out democracy. Accounting, organizations and society, 16 (7), pp.673â€“692.</h1>

<p>The essay looks at the relationship between quantification and democratic government or the relationship between democratic power and calculated power. Rose started his argument by first categorising the use of numbers into 4 classifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numerical calculations of majorities and minorities</li>
<li>Numerical calculations linking governments with the lives of the governed such as opinion polls</li>
<li>Numerical calculations based on authoritative powers over national life, such as balance in payments, gross national product&hellip;</li>
<li>Numerical calculations for governing: tax returns, counts of population.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this was an explanations of &ldquo;numericization of politics&rdquo;, then Rose goes on explaining the &ldquo;politics of numbers&rdquo; (p,674)</p>

<ul>
<li>Politics of accuracy</li>
<li>Politics of adequacy</li>
<li>Politics of use and abuse, &ldquo;elaborated in particular by civil liberties&rdquo;</li>
<li>Politics of privacy, deployed by libertarians.</li>
<li>Politics of ethics, morality of making decisions based on numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rose argues according to Starr and Alonso&rsquo;s work that there is a reciprocal and mutual constitutive relationship between numbers and Politics, In a way they are like map and terrain relationship, they both related to each others reality and creates each others essence and appearance.</p>

<h3 id="rose-39-s-hypothesis">Rose&rsquo;s hypothesis:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There is a constitutive interrelationship between quantification and democratic government. Democratic power is calculated power, and numbers are intrinsic to the forms of justification that give legitimacy to political power in democracies. democratic power is calculating power, and numbers are integral to the technologies that seek to give effect to democracy as a particular set of mechanisms of rule. Democratic power requires citizens who calculate about power, and numeracy and a numericized space of public discourse are essential fore making up self-controlling democratic citizens.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the question would be techniques to identify and study such phenomenons</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and knowledge&rdquo;, this is all Foucault&rsquo;s work</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To governs a domain &ndash; a population, an economy &ndash; has entailed seeking to exercise a power over it that is modulated by a knowledge of its laws, processes and conditions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Link between government and information&rdquo;, see more in Pasquale Pasquino&rsquo;s work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There can be no well-ordered political machinery or enlightened administration, they argue, without a knowledge of the state of the population, and the numbering of persons, goods, activities, births, crimes, deaths and much else provides the material on which administrative calculation can operate. (p, 676)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Centres of calculation, for more on this see Latour&rsquo;s works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To exercise power over events and processes distant from oneself it is necessary to turn them into traces that can be mobalised and accumulated. Events must be inscribed in standardized forms, the inscriptions transported from far and wide and accumulated in a central locale, where they can be aggregated, compared, compiled and calculated about.
&hellip;.
Further Rose suggests based on Ian Hacking&rsquo;s argument(1981)
&ldquo;Turning the objects of government into numericized inscriptions, then, enables a machinery of government to operate from centres that calculate.  &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Techniques of inscription and accumulation of facts about &ldquo;the population&rdquo;, the &ldquo;national economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;. This renders a visible domain with a certain internal homogeneity and external boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The collections and aggregation of numbers participates in the fabruication of &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; within which thought and action can occur. Numbers here delineate &ldquo;fictive spaces&rdquo; for the operation of government, and establish a &ldquo;plane of reality&rdquo;, marked out by a grid of norms, on which government can operate. (Miller &amp; O&#39;Leary, 1987, Rose, 1988, Miller &amp; Rose, 1990).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Censor</strong> comes from Romans and it meant the person who censed they were in charge of counting people who are good at taxation, military and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> comes from 17th century German notion of a science of states.</p>
