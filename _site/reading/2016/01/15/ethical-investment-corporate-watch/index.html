    <h2 class="post-header">Ethical Investment What it is and how it works</h2>
    <p class="post-meta">2016-01-15</p>

    <h1 id="summary-of-important-notes">Summary of important notes:</h1>

<p>The modern concept of ethical investment initiated in America in the 18th century (1758) by groups such as Quakers.</p>

<p>Events such as the apartheid South Africa and Vietnam war played a key role in divestment and SRI.</p>

<p>What is ethical investment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the term &lsquo;ethical investment&rsquo; is usually used to mean the integration of ethical values and social and environmental considerations into investment decisions, rather than basing such decisions solely on financial calculations (expected risks and returns).
What is ethical investment according to USSIF, formerly known as the Social Investment Forum SIF:
a process of identifying and investing in companies that meet certain baseline standards or criteria of Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment Initiative (PRI)</p>

<p>What are the six principles defined by PRI?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they are based on the framework of three aspects: environment, society and corporate governance (ESG).</p>

<p>conventional portfolio theory! is that a &lsquo;diversifed portfolio&rsquo; would reduce the &lsquo;risk of exposure&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>some of the issues that are making ethical investment complicated are:
- mixed funds: this is when an investor is investing in good and bad companies, this will make them harder to identify and expose. Same thing could happen if the company is getting funds from mixed investors which means different influencing actors.
- Complicated production lines: This is when manufacturers or companies sell part of their production to other companies and manufacturers who produce weapons or other unethical products. An example of this is the Co-operative supermarket. This is also hard to identify as companies revenues and sales may not be publicly available. An example of this complication is The body shop, they have been bought by L&#39;Oreal in 2006 and in addition 30% of L&#39;Oreal share is owned by Nestle&rsquo;</p>
