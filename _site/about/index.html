    <p>I&rsquo;m a PhD student based at school of design University of Edinburgh.
The focus of my PhD is on <strong>Disruptive design and Technological fluency</strong>.</p>

<p>Technological fluency means:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technological fluency is the ability to be creative with technology; it is a vital component in a participatory culture in which the design, use, and evaluation of technologies is an open process that goes beyond the purview of experts (Lukens 2012)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disruptive design means:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Form of practice in design, where designers primary aim is to raise awareness about a certain technology, beyond practice and thinking broadly about technology, interrelationship between in-
formation resources, technological structures, and market forces (National Research Council, Committee on Information Technology Literacy 1999).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am conducting a practice based research and I developed two substantial pieces of work</p>

<ol>
<li>Investigating some of the approaches that we collect information about people online through social media and in response I developed a gossip technology.</li>
<li>Investigating how advertising companies such as google filter knowledge and information and how we can disrupt this, in response to the theories, I developed open bubble an open source browser extension that will mimic the behavior of the users and tries to diversify users&rsquo; online persona.</li>
</ol>
