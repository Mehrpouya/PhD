#Introduction:

#Questions:

- What the research problem is
- What the major concepts and constructs are
- How the major concepts relate to each other
- What efforts have been made in the past to solve the problem (literature)
- Which elements of the problem remain unsolved
- What barriers stand in the way of solving the problem
- Which modes of investigation now seem appropriate
- Why the problem remains viable and how findings might contribute to theory or practice.

##What my problem is
- Supreme leader doesn't like humanities and social sciences, so I studied Software engineering instead and ended up in Scotland with an MSc in Computer Games Technologies in Dundee
- MSc final project which was an interactive Dance project got to know Simon Biggs, moved to ECA and from 2013 Chris been my mentor, manager, supervisor and friend and since been working on very exciting projects.
- Find relevant methods to my practice
- Create a nieche to be able to continue with my own practice
- Contribute to the community who funded my PhD (British public / rest of the world)



##What the research problem is

The original purpose of my [PhD][phd] was to study the following:

- How digital technologies are transforming community narratives into the digital sphere (For example see, Knoydart community's [energy consumption visualisation][knoydart-vis]).
- How these digital spheres and spaces are being used by the community.
- How these approaches to heterogeneous and non-hegemonic modes of development, innovation and production could effect design.

The study aimed to specifically focus on "off grid" communities.

My PhD is practice based and therefore to follow these questions, I did four pilot studies to gain better understanding of the "whats" first.

For example:

- What is data?
- What is a grid?
- What is off grid?
- What is a community?
- What does it mean to be responsible in the context of selected (Knoydart, Isle of Eigg and Gaza strip) off grid communities?


During the first year of my research I developed 4 interventions within different contexts, each of them designed and developed with different aims to explore the main questions.

The four interventions are as follows:

- **Mobility on Isle of Eigg**: ethnographic methods, auto ethnography, video ethnography, interview techniques.
- **Power of Knoydart**: Research through design, Action Research
- **Zaytoun**: digital data, data visualisation and issues of localisation and materialisation of information
- **Personal Grids**: quantified self, study of personal grids
