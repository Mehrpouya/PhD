#Intro



The original purpose of my [PhD][phd] was to study the following:

- How digital technologies are transforming community narratives into the digital sphere (For example see, Knoydart community's [energy consumption visualisation][knoydart-vis]).
- How these digital spheres and spaces are being used by the community.
- How these approaches to heterogeneous and non-hegemonic modes of development, innovation and production could effect design.

The study aimed to specifically focus on "off grid" communities.

My PhD is practice based and therefore to follow these questions, I did four pilot studies to gain better understanding of the "whats" first.

For example:

- What is a grid?
- What is off grid?
- What is a community?
- What does it mean to be responsible in the context of selected (Knoydart, Isle of Eigg and Gaza strip) off grid communities?

During the first year of my research I developed 4 interventions within different contexts, each of them designed and developed with different aims to explore the main questions.

The four interventions are as follows:

- **Mobility on Isle of Eigg**: Literature review on mobility turn, ethnographic methods, auto ethnography, video ethnography, interview techniques.
- **Power of Knoydart**: Research through design, Action Research
- **Zaytoun**: digital data, data visualisation and issues of localisation and materialisation of information
- **Personal Grids**: quantified self, study of personal grids

##Rational of the pilot studies
Practice based research as Wessling(2011) argues in her book "See it again, say it again. The Artist as Researcher" is a recently recognised mode of research. Over the last 3 decades the method gone through various changes and individual approaches.  There are not many unified views about practice led research and research through art as the practice.
Sulivan (2011) categorised the changing contexts of framing (methodology) within research into three approaches as follows:
>
- research is a logical and linear process of intervention and inquiry that builds on what we know
- research responds to issues and problems that need to be interpreted in real-life contexts.
- artistic research can reveal new insights through creative and critical practice.

The result of the first and second approaches are methodologies such as empirical research and site-based research, however the third characterisation is more aligned to the recent practice led PhDs and researches.
The challenge with the artistic research according to Sullivan (2011) from the point of view of knowledge creation are:
>
- How are theories constructed that interpret and explain who we are and what we do in visual arts and design?
- How is new knowledge created and communicated?
- What new research methods are needed for the complex visual and virtual worlds of today?

The above questions and also the challenge of threading anthropology, design and informatics together for the practice based research was another central issue of the research...

##Brief summary of each pilot study:
### Mobility on Isle of Eigg
The aim of this work was to study transport on Isle of Eigg. The objective of the study was to develop better understanding of linking mobility and energy use.
#### Method

Triangulating data sources and methods for data collection started around 1959, a move initiated by Campell and Fisk in order to minimise the biases that each individual method generates. Originally this approach was more focused on convergence and around 1990 researchers started to mix their methods, in a way that one question or method leads to another instead of using them independently of one another. There are three main strategies for conducting research using mixed methods, Sequential, Concurrent and Transformative. The main difference between each of these methods is when and how they are mixing qualitative and quantitative data collection methods or strategies. In Sequential, the research starts with one method leading to another, for example starting research with a survey and a follow up interview with a smaller number of participants in order to be able to generalise the results of the survey more easily. The concurrent approach, as the name suggests, is when the researcher collects both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time in order to develop a well formed understanding of the problem or research question (Creswell, 2013).
Mobility is a complex area of inquiry and as explained before it requires an advanced mix of methods and strategies in order to be able to project a better light on the concept. Mixed method will provide the ability to mix qualitative and quantitative methods, and this is not limited to the data collection methods, but it means both approaches are being used in tandem so the overall strength of the research will become greater than each individual method (Creswell, 2013).
In this study our aim was to look at the history of mobility on Isle of Eigg and how it has been changed over the years. This research opportunity became available through the Off Grid project, with which I am involved as part of a collaboration between ETN and Isle of Eigg. We used a customised Twizy car, made by Renault as a probe to look at mobility on the island. This trial provided us with an opportunity to be able to speak with individuals on Eigg. The trial designed by ETN used both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques and strategies. GPS tracker was in place to store the usage data of the car, in addition to a diary technique, so the participants can enter their experience with the car.
Another reason for choosing mixed methods for this study is my personal position in this research. Crouch & Pearce (2012) discuss the importance of the investigators position within the context of the research. Having a background in computer science and being literate in programming languages, it will make it easier to use quantitative approaches to data collection and on the other hand working in the design school as a designer and artist is a factor that allows me to use qualitative methods. Considering these two factors and the nature of the research, mixed methods is the best fit for the purpose of this research.
An further factor to consider is the audience, as mentioned before this research has been funded by ETN and Off Grid project from UoE. This collaboration brings specific data collection needs for each individual partner of the project. ETN is more interested in usage data, GPS data collection and diaries. Their audience are Psychology journals and also publicity for their company, however Off Grid project is based at School of Social Anthropology and therefore they are more keen on Qualitative approaches, such as interviews, image analysis, ethnography and field observations.

##Power of Knoydart:
#Phillips Light Bulb Diary:

The Phillips Light Bulb project was recently featured in the [Herald Scotland][herald] and [Deadline News][deadlinenews], and as part of the development team behind the work, I thought it would be helpful to document how the project was developed and the code behind the project.

## How it all came together:

In August 2014 [Jamie Cross][Jamie], Co-Investigator of the [Off the Grid][offgrid] asked [myself][Hadi] and [Margus Lind][Margus] to join another project that he was leading in collaboration with [Knoydart Foundation][knoydartfoundation], [Local Energy Scotland][localenergyscot] and [Community Energy Scotland][communityenergy].

The project was conceived following the development of a few data visualisations to try and find a way to translate the data from this tracker, and fragility of this micro-hydro into something more meaningful for the community without creating panic.

![Tracker](/assets/Knoydart/tracker.jpg) ![Hydro](/assets/Knoydart/hydro.jpg)

Sitting in the [Knoydart bunkhouse][bunkhouse], the three of us were joined by [Kyle Smith][Kyle] operations manager of [Knoydart Foundation][knoydartfoundation] and [Benny Talbot][Benny] from Community Energy Scotland. We were trying to find a way to engage with the community and tourists about how to have better awareness of energy consumption to avoid power cuts and develop ways to use the surplus energy.

After a couple of hours of writing down ideas and sketches, [Kyle][Kyle] enquired as to whether we had seen the new [Phillips smart light bulbs][phillipshue]. None of us have heard about them before, however after a few more hours of research, the next day [Margus][Margus] developed the first hack of the light bulb. We managed on our last night in Knoydart to install it on one of the computers in the community library. The purpose was to change the color of the light bulb according to the community energy consumption.

And this is what we left there for the following 3 months.

![Phillips Hue in the library](/assets/Knoydart/philips-library.jpg)

##First evaluation:

We ran focus groups, interviewed people and made various versions of our visualisations. Finally the community were happy with three final designs.

![focus group](/assets/Knoydart/first-focusgroup.jpg)


1:Smart light bulb

2:The new [Power of knoydart website][powerofknoydart]

3:Data kettle (a widget for windows computers that shows the amount of energy consumption as a water level in a kettle).


When we went back to Knoydart at the end of same year, we found out that not many people knew about our [Power of knoydart website][powerofknoydart]. Furthermore all of the lights in the library have been removed, and sadly not many people installed our kettle on their computers.

Not knowing about our website or the kettle widget was because of reasons as simple as: some lost the link to the page, some didn't know about it, and some found it unreliable that the page was often down.

The lights being moved from the library was again because our script lost communication with data server and the light bulb.

##Iterations:

To solve the advertising problem [Jamie][Jamie] printed out 300 water proof stickers that could be put in different locations as a point of reference. We've got one on our meeting room at Design informatics, here at University of Edinburgh!

To solve the reliability problem, we asked [Chris Barker][chrisbarker] to join our team. The two of us developed a new and clean page for [Power of Knoydart][powerofknoydart], made it more resilient and made an easy installation for the [data kettle][datakettle] and we all advertised it on any medium that we could, for example Twitter, Facebook and other social networks.

The last problem was to draw attention to the light bulb. We needed to bring it to somewhere more public and in the view of both tourists and the community.
We made a new version of the code which is documented and accessible on here: [Power of Knoydart][githubknoydart]



##Open source code and documentation:
I will publish the Phillips Python code on the [Power of Knoydart website][githubknoydart] in the next couple of days.
Here's how to do it yourself:

##Here's how we hacked the Phillips light:
Get yourself a:

**Raspberry pie** (Instead of using a big computer, use one of these to save power and easy installation)

**Phillips Hue**

**Miniature wifi** (You need this to connect to the internet)


First You need to install a couple of libraries on the Raspberry pie in order to talk to the Phillips Hue light bulb.

Here's the list of libraries:

**interp** (You need this to convert numerical ranges, for example in our case if we're using 10kwh of electricity convert it to a range of green and if it's more that 140 - 180 convert it to a range of red)


**phue** (This is the important library that let's you speak with the smart bulb)

That's it. Install these by [googling][google] or [ducking][duckduckgo] their name and python together.

And here's the simple code:

```python
'''IP address of the Phillips Hue'''
b = phue.Bridge(0.0.0.0)
'''You can get it from their online console.'''
b.connect()
b.get_api()
r=0
sys.stdout.flush()

```
And then, changing light bulbs color according to your data, in my case it was a number between 0-180

```python
if num>150 and num<=180: #num has the number I mentioned, the data you want to visualise into light colors.
    hue=int(interp(r,[150,180],[5000,1])) #interp will interpolate the values to the range I want here is red
elif num>100 and num<=150:
    hue=int(interp(r,[100,150],[15000,10000]))#here is yellow
elif num>0 and num<=100:
    hue=int(interp(r,[0,100],[30000,25000]))#green
bri=255 #brightness of the light
sat=254 #saturation of the light
lights = b.lights #this will give me the list of light bulbs to iterate through
command = {#preparing a command to send to the Phillips Hue controller
        'transitiontime': 3,#how long to take to change to a new color.
        'on': True,
        'bri': 255,
        'hue': hue,
        'sat': 255
    }
for l in lights:#iterate through and change colors.
    print(l.name)
    b.set_light(l.name, command)
time.sleep(10)
```

##Eigg mobility:

In Summer 2014 [Eco Travel Network(ETN)][ETN] - a limited company based in Wales , started a [2 month trial][etn-trial] of the [Bruce][Renault Bruce] on Isle of Eigg as an alternative low carbon road transport.

![This is how Twizy looks like](/images/twizy.jpg)

Eigg is one of the few places in the UK to produce their own electricity from renewable sources of energy (wind, solar and hydro). While


A "mostly any cars we had were old"
The practicalities of the life on Eigg, are very different to what people living in the cities are used to. Whilst the energy is very visible on the island through its sources that are loud and present in the landscape like the big wind turbines, or shiny solar panels, the practicality of living on the island creates so much need for use of carbon intensive, fossil fuels.

One John and Mary farmers from Eigg mentioned:
>We use about 20 tonnes of feed stuffs a year in bags. For the cows and sheep. We have to move it up to the farm first and then on a daily basis we will use about 10 bags…
F:	In the winter.
M:	…so that is 250kg and then we decide how we are going to move it. I might throw 6 bags in the Land Rover and Orla will take 4 on her bike to do the sheep or vice versa. Or if it's really, really bad we will put them in the trailer on the quad and go that way. We are constantly balancing the transport needs against what specific task we have.

The vehicle has been equipped with a GPS device in order to record its movements and use on Eigg. In addition to this ETN also used diary research method to collect some qualitative measures from each family using the car for a period of one week.

As part of the residency, the following visualisation shows one month of collected data using Cartodb platform.

The primary aim of ETN in this trial is to find ways to make individuals linking between personal travel and energy. this research requires mix of methods and approaches to develop a way to entangle some of the complexities around linking community, mobility and energy. I will be using mix of ethnography methods during this 10 days, interviews, mobile methods: giving a lift to people on Eigg and using gopro and microphone to record some of the conversations and the experice of driving the car and journey, photography and at the end a feedback session in collaboration with Eco Travel Network including all fifteen families who used Twizy.

#Zaytoun

Networked journalism, a recent trend through the development of Web 2.0 and 3.0 technologies such as micro-blogging and social media gave birth to a new form of interaction between the traditional notion of journalism and the public (Beckett 2010). The spread of smartphones and Internet to all corners of the world has given individuals a global voice for what they see, hear and observe.

Bradshaw (2012) discusses some of the hidden practices within Data Journalism such as methods that journalists use to filter the data, vast data collection techniques and data mining methods to generate new forms of information from digitised data. The complexity of the practice and issues with data overload in the modern age also brings in concerns about data privileges. For instance, how various kinds of information such as wars, diseases and corruption compete with one another.

The piece ‘Zaytoun’, was created in response to the 50 days war in the Gaza Strip of Occupied Palestine during the summer of 2014. Graphite-based conductive ink on top of an emotive illustration by artist Mina Braun affords the opportunity for direct interaction with the drawing. Touches across the textured surface trigger a change in the capacitance of the circuit, which is detected by the various analogue pins of an Arduino Mega micro controller. When a threshold of electrical current is broken, the program sends text to a pair of thermal receipt printers.

One of the thermal printers prints names of individuals who died during this war and the other prints collected local stories from twitter. The stories included within this work are collected from individuals living inside Gaza strip, Jerusalem and the West Bank, reporting the current crisis. Names of people who lost their lives, during and since the invasion are downloaded periodically from Al-Khabar (Al-Khabar 2014) website which gets the list from Gaza Ministry of Health. In order to capture this data we developed a PHP program that converted and stored it using JSON standard for use within the visualisation.

The illustration consists of families and an olive tree  (see: Mehrpouya, 2014). Olive trees are internationally recognised as a symbol of peace. In Palestine they are also a symbol of unity and the relationship people have with their lands. Not only have the Palestinians been oppressed and forced to give up their lands but also vast numbers of these trees have been bulldozed or moved to occupied lands and inside Israel (See: Khoury 2013, Booth 2014).

The invasion and bombardment of Gaza coincided with the run up to a symposium on the production of data, organised by the research centre for Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Submission of the drawing was not only an opportunity to bring human suffering to the fore in an academic community which can, on occasion, be isolated from the ‘real world’. There was also a desire to preserve the personal nature of the data that major events inevitably generate now.

## Data, Why Twitter?
Everyday over 95 million messages get shared between users and twitter as a mediator of a real-time information network among all of its users (Huberman et al. 2008). This creates a contested space, with various biases and concerns, for instance institutions who are more code-savvy and have an ability to automate and mass produce tweets. Also individuals with specific political agendas who can create various trends and biased information. The twitter system itself also tends to filter the daily 95 million tweets and tailor them to the interests of the user or perhaps the interests of twitter advertisers. This complexity, while providing an area of uncertainty and a blurred reliability (See: Stephanie 2009, Acar & Muraki 2011), in disastrous situations also allows people to communicate in a more meaningful way with the people from outside and inside their countries (for examples see: Acar & Muraki 2011, Heverin & Zach 2010, Vieweg et al. 2010) .

In this piece we needed to collect information about local stories reported by people directly involved in the disaster and solid numbers and figures which turned out to be a very challenging aspect of this work (For example the #gazaunderattack hashtag over the course of recent Israel election in the past week on average had about 6 thousand tweets per day (Topsy 2015)) As has been the case in the past with 24-hour rolling news, the actual persistence of this public content has been relatively flimsy. Stories and photos, unless recirculated in the ‘traditional media’ or archived by individuals, are difficult to track down after the event. One example is the above hashtag. Researchers were able to periodically scrape tweets from the API and saved over 267,000. However, on a recent search there were only some few hundred reported.

##Reflection and Discussion:

Following our installation at University of Edinburgh Producing Data Conference, we made some changes to the collected stories of this piece and also some improvements at interaction level.

We did not collect any qualitative or quantitative data about this piece during its installation at the conference nor its installation at Edinburgh college of art except for the thread of printed paper itself that represents the number of times the drawing has been touched.

Over the course of the two installations we found that use of illustration and art as a way to communicate with digital data and numbers will create a very personal and strong link with the observers. We informally interviewed some of the participants at the Producing Data conference and one individual stated that he “never realised the war was still going on” and the majority of observers found the lengthy prints on receipt paper and personal stories very strong and communicative.

We also found that the majority of people who looked at piece did not touch the illustration for reasons such as being scared of damaging the art work or not understanding the dynamics of the interaction. Over the course of two weeks only 65 individuals touched the illustration. The less formal location for display in the Evolution House building may also have contributed to this somewhat. The only direct feedback in the user experience is the sound of the printers triggering. If this is inaudible it is unclear that a touch was successful. For our exhibition in V&A Digital Futures as Part of pre EVA-London conference we are planning to make the interaction part more clear and collect more qualitative feedback.

--------------------------

#Conclusion and next steps:
[Jamie Cross][Jamie Cross] well [said][lse-jamie]:
>One lesson from the University of Edinburgh’s work with communities living off the grid is that making sense of data means thinking about how it can be materialised as well as visualised.

One of the promises of data age is mobility both in temporal and spatial senses. In temporal through the manifestation of data bases and visualisation of events through the digital mediums (for examples see: [Guardian timeline visualisation of arab spring][arab spring], Recent approaches by anthropologists and ethnographers like the Vannini's work [life off the grid][phillip vannini])  t Over the next two years of this research 4 installations will be exhibited to study the role of time and space in how we associate ourselves with other communities.

Next steps:
Over the next two years of this project, 4 new interventions will be developed with empathy in the center of it from different geographical and temporal perspectives. each of these installations will show a different hidden layer of modern life.

The first intervention of the four will be about South African mining exploitation as a geographically distanced disaster and looking at ways to develop a longitudinal relationship with the issue.

The piece consists of a central tube which geometrically very similar to the mining silo
