#Introduction:
looking at Markets from sociological perspective, how Markets and Governments by using the dynamism of technology and competition managed to develop the MARKET SOCIETY. technology and competition are also defined and changed by markets and governments.


##Good stuff:

>"Technological change certainly can have independent effects on social structures. But technological change can have these effects only where the social organization exists that makes technology relevant". **p4p3**

This is very good as it can arguably connects with ANT view actors and also try to find traces of why we invest and do things the way we do? Why we use proxies in the way we use them, for exmaple when we look for mortgage we chose the best one tha gives the best number and we use proxies to accept that all banks are the same so therefore don't think about other parameters for your mortgage.

This argument opens up route to many actors, enterprenours who work out the relevant uses of the technology, delivery techniques, making them reliable, realisation that this product will make profit. competition is another actor here which as Fligstein argues produces social-organizational responses.

>"Economic sociology is the study of how the material production and consumption of human populations depend on social processes for their structure and dynamics." **p6bottom**

>"Modern economic theory claims to be a general theory about how people interact in order to materially reprosuce themselves (i.e., how they allocate scarce resources to different ends), and, therefore, it is assumed to be applicable to all societies at all times.)" **p7bottom**

>"... Economic processes as generic social processes operating in particular institutional situation, that is, the construction of markets. "
