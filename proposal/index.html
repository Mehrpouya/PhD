    <h1 id="summary:">Summary:</h1>

<p>My PhD is about Complicity and how Design-Informatics could be used as a new design intervention method. I want to use my software and hardware skill s to develop about 10 interventions to understand complicity and methods to create it. My study has two strands, one is at personal level and one at institutional and community level.</p>

<h2 id="complicity:">Complicity:</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="navy">Involved with others in an activity that is unlawful or morally wrong: the careers of those complicit in the cover-up were blighted.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="methods:">Methods:</h1>

<p>To study complicity I want to learn how you experience it at personal level and at community level. At personal level I had done one hour of study of my own work and documented some data about it. I will explain this further in the Method one section. And at institutional level I decided to work with the communiy I&rsquo;m already part of, University of Edinburgh. This will be through a campaign about University investments with the idea of complicity in the middle of it (How to make staff and students more responsible and feel connected to the their share of contribution to these unethical investments). The campaign will be around fossil fuel Investments by University of Edinburgh. Currently there are campaigns and many efforts by some of the students and staff in the University to Divest from Fossil fuels but not successful yet. I will look at the current efforts. Outside Uni out of many, a major one I am planning to follow is the Guardian&rsquo;s “Keep it underground” campaign.</p>

<h2 id="method-one:">Method one:</h2>

<h3 id="personal-grids:">Personal grids:</h3>

<p>I am developing a study of personal grids at the moment, The code can be found at [1] and a demo of it at [2]. Now I am in the process of expanding the grid and start quantifying some of the data. For example how much oil was being burnt to use one hour o my shirt, one cup of coffee, one hour of my mobile and so on. With this method I am hoping to develop a way for studying grids and study complicity at personal level. Intervention one: This will be a web-based application helping you to study your grid. Like finding out about different parts of your grid. Some will be obvious like national grid, energy providers and so on and some less obvious for example Let&rsquo;s say you add what you&rsquo;re wearing, your jumper at the moment is from H&amp;M, what does that mean? How do they produce it and so on. Or how much energy and resources it takes to make a cup of coffee. I will add information about some of the hidden practices. Users can explore these by changing parameter through the day. Or do one hour study of themselves with the method I design and explore their own grid.</p>

<h2 id="method-two:">Method two:</h2>

<p>will study complicity through public interventions. This will be through series of 10 Interventions. The intervention will be around the theme of Fossil fuel Investments at this stage focusing at University of Edinburgh. UoE is one of the only two Higher Education Institutions in the world that joined the UN-PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) since 2006. The University holds 779 Endowments, and invests about £284m. 65% in Equity, 20% in fixed interest stocks, 11% property and 4% cash and working capital. The University of Edinburgh is the 3rd largest endowment investor in the UK, investing in more than 100 companies such as Shell, Tesco and total. There will be two major events on Septembers 2015 and 2016 when new students are coming in. These are my two tides. The interventions will be in University buildings.</p>

<h1 id="allegory:">Allegory:</h1>

<p>In 2015 UK invested £1bn in the development of the first power-generating tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay. This tidal lagoons could provide up to 8% of the UK energy needs. This project is along the seawall and two miles into the sea and the hydros are generating electricity by each of the rising and falling tides
Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to design something that pushes everybody to think about Fossil fuel investments and their responsibility about it by being a member of the organization.</li>
<li>How to design with complicity or complicit-me?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="documentation:">Documentation:</h1>

<p>All these projects will be documented and stored on Github.</p>

<h2 id="currently-studying:">Currently studying:</h2>

<ul>
<li> Guardian Campaign – Keep it underground:</li>
<li> What are they doing, how they are promoting their work. Can I contribute?</li>
<li> What sensor technologies I can use to collect data that would be interesting in two years time?</li>
<li> What databases currently exists that I can make use of?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ideas-for-interventions:">Ideas for interventions:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Smart batches</li>
<li>University Investments visualisation</li>
<li>Graph based web-page to follow different branches of work and campaign work being done within different parts of Investment mess. For example you can see how much the work on Divesting from Shell progressed and so on. Democracy cafe or Grid ethics committee – Provide free coffee and develop a space for discussions on University grid ethics</li>
<li>Visualisation showing how close University of Edinburgh is to War crimes.</li>
<li> Design an object inspired by Tweenbot or coget, something people will peggyback to Chancellor of Edinburgh University?</li>
</ul>
